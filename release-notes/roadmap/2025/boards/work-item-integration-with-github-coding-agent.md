# Work Item integration with GitHub Copilot coding agent

Building on the capabilities available with GitHub Issues, we are extending GitHub Copilot coding agent integration to Azure Boards work items. This enhancement enables Azure Boards users to leverage Copilot Coding to review work items, generate implementation plans, create draft pull requests, make code changes, and receive notifications when pull requests are ready for review. You can continue collaborating with the coding agent directly within the GitHub pull request.
