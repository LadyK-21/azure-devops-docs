### Azure Pipeline agent v4 runs on .NET 8


The Azure Pipeline agent v3 currently uses .NET 6, but with the end-of-life for .NET 6 approaching, we're upgrading the agent to .NET 8. This update will be rolled out over the coming weeks.

If you're using self-hosted agents on an operating system that isn't supported by .NET 8, your agent wonâ€™t be upgraded to v4. Instead, pipelines running on unsupported operating systems display warnings in the pipeline logs. You can use the [QueryAgentPoolsForCompatibleOS.ps1 script](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-agent/tree/master/tools/FindAgentsNotCompatibleWithAgent) to identify any pipeline agents running on outdated operating systems proactively.

The following operating system versions won't be supported by the updated v4 agent:

- Alpine Linux 3.13 - 3.16
- Debian 10
- Fedora 36 - 38
- macOS 10 & 11
- openSUSE 15.0 - 15.4
- Oracle Linux 7
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
- SUSE Enterprise Linux 12
- Ubuntu, 16.04, 18.04
- Windows 7, 8 & 10 up to 21H2
