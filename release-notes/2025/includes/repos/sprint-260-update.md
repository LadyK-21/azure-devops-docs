### Improved screen reader support for pull request experience

We improved support for screen readers in Pull Request experience.
The new option in built-in code editor will allow to enable announcements for line changes and comments.

To enable new option, on Pull Request page click "File" tab:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Image to show file tab.](../../media/260-repos-01.png "Image to show file tab.")](../../media/260-repos-01.png#lightbox) 

After that, click on "Editor preferences" button:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Image to Editor preferences button.](../../media/260-repos-02.png "Image to Editor preferences button.")](../../media/260-repos-02.png#lightbox)

In opened popup menu enable "Enable announcements for line changes and comments to enhance screen reader accessibility" option and click on "Save" button:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Image to Editor preferences.](../../media/260-repos-03.png "Image to Editor preferences.")](../../media/260-repos-03.png#lightbox)
