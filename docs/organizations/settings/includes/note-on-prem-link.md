> The Inheritance process model is available for projects that are configured to support the model type. If you use an older collection, check the process model compatibility.

For more information, see [Organization-level process customization](../../../reference/customize-work.md?preserve-view=true&view=azure-devops-2019#organization-level-process-customization).
