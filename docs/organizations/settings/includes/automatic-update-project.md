> [!NOTE]   
> When you customize an inherited process, any projects that use the process automatically reflect the customizations. To ensure a smooth transition, we recommend that you create a test process and project to test your customizations before you implement them organization-wide. For more information, see [Create and manage inherited processes](../work/manage-process.md).
