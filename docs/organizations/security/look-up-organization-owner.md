# Look up the organization owner

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Each organization has a single owner who can add users, adjust access levels, manage permissions, and customize projects. You can find the owner in your organization settings.

To change the **Organization owner**, see [Change organization owner](../accounts/change-organization-ownership.md). 

## Prerequisites
