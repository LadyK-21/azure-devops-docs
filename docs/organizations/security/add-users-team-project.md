# Add users or groups to a team or project

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

This article shows how to add users or groups to a team or project. For organizations with large user bases, we recommend you use Microsoft Entra ID to add and manage new users through security groups. However, to enable flexibility for all size organizations, Azure DevOps supports the procedures described in this article.

## Supported options for adding users 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

Depending on your administrator level and interface, you can add new or existing users to teams or projects in the following ways.

::: moniker-end 
::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

Team and project administrators can add existing users to their team or project. An existing user is any user recognized by a project collection through the Active Directory or Windows Group created for the server that hosts the on-premises Azure DevOps Server.

## Add a user from the Team Members widget

As a team administrator, you can add new or existing members from the **Team Members** dashboard widget. For more information, see [Add widgets to a dashboard](../../report/dashboards/add-widget-to-dashboard.md). 
 
1. Sign in to your project (`https://dev.azure.com/<My_Organization>/<My_Project>`).

1. Select **Dashboards** and then choose your dashboard to open it in Azure DevOps:

   :::image type="content" source="../../report/dashboards/media/dashboards/open-dashboards-vert.png" alt-text="Screenshot the Dashboards tab open for a project in Azure DevOps.":::

1. Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/add-team-member-plus-sign-blue.png"::: **Manage team members** on the Team Members widget:

	:::image type="content" source="media/add-users/team-member-widget.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot of the Team Members widget on a dashboard with the Manage team members action (the plus symbol) highlighted.":::

1. Enter the display name or email address for the user to add to the project dashboard:

   - For an existing user, enter the information until the dialog shows a matching entry in the system. Select the matching entry, and then select **Add**. You can add multiple users by separating the entries with a semicolon (**;**). 

	- For a new user unrecognized by the system, enter the complete email address including the domain, such as `fabrikam-user@fabrikam.com`. When you add an unrecognized user, you see a notification that an access level must be assigned for the user. To complete the action, select **Add**:
      
	   :::image type="content" source="media/add-users/invite-members-dialog-add-info.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Invite members to a team dialog, add new user account.":::

	   The system assigns the **Stakeholder** access level for the new user, when all of the five Basic (free) access levels are already assigned. Active contributors to a project need to have **Basic** access as a minimum. A **Project Collection Administrator** can change the access level and resend invitations from the [**Organization Settings** > **Users** page](#manage-users-or-resend-invitations).

	> [!NOTE]
	> Users with limited access, such as **Stakeholders**, can't access select features even if granted permissions to those features. For more information, see [Permissions and access](permissions-access.md).

When the process completes, a notification briefly displays to indicate success or failure. You can select **Details** to open the notification and review the details:

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
   **User added successfully**

   :::image type="content" source="media/add-users/notification-success.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot of the Notification success message.":::

   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
   **Failed to add specified user**

   :::image type="content" source="media/add-users/notification-failure.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot of the Notification failure message.":::
       
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="":::

   :::image type="content" source="media/add-users/summary-invite-notifications-success.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Notification dialog showing details about the successful operation.":::

   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::

   :::image type="content" source="media/add-users/notification-failure-outside-directory.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Notification dialog showing details about why the operation failed.":::

   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

When the operation succeeds, new users receive an email invitation to sign in to the project. Existing users don't receive a formal notification.

## Add users or groups to a team 

You can add existing users or security groups to a team from the **Team Settings** menu. To add a custom security group, see [Use security groups to manage users and groups](add-remove-manage-user-group-security-group.md).   

The first time you add a user or group to Azure DevOps, you can't browse directly to it or check the friendly name. After Azure DevOps verifies the identity, you can browse for the user or group by using the friendly name. For example, you can browse on the friendly name _Projects_ to locate the verified group, _fabrikam-projects@fabrikam.com (Projects for Fabrikam)_.

## Add users or groups to a project

As a member of the **Project Administrators** group, you can add users or groups to a project. You add the new project member to a security group on the **Project Settings** > **Permissions** page. To add a custom security group, see [Add or remove users or groups, manage security groups](add-remove-manage-user-group-security-group.md).

#### [Preview UI](#tab/preview-page)

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

1. Sign in to your project (`https://dev.azure.com/<My_Organization>/<My_Project>`).

1. Select **Project Settings** > **Permissions**: 

   :::image type="content" source="media/permissions/project-settings-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Project Settings, Permissions section.":::

1. In the security **Groups** section, select the security group-level to use for the new project members. You can choose any security group in the list, which includes any defined team groups. Here are some examples:

   - **Readers**: Read-only access to the project.
   - **Contributors**: Full contributor privileges to the project, which is equivalent to **Stakeholder** access.
   - **Project Administrators**: Administrator privileges for the project. For more information, see [Change project-level permissions](change-project-level-permissions.md).

   This example uses the **Contributors** security group:

   :::image type="content" source="media/add-users/open-contributors-groups.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot of the Security groups page showing the Contributors group selected." lightbox="media/add-users/open-contributors-groups.png":::

   After you select the security group, the configuration page opens.

1. In the configuration page for the security group, select the **Members** tab.

   The default team group, and any other teams defined for the project, are automatically included as members of the **Contributors** group. On this tab, you select other users and groups to become members. If you add new users to a project team, they automatically become members of the **Contributors** security group and gain the related permissions. 

   > [!TIP]
   > It can be easier to [manage permissions for users by working with groups](../../organizations/security/about-permissions.md) rather than setting permissions at the user level. When you set permissions for a group, all members of the group inherit the group permissions. You can then adjust permissions for specific users in the group, as needed.

1. On the **Members** tab, select **Add**:

   :::image type="content" source="media/add-users/add-users-to-contributors.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Contributors security group configuration page showing the Add option highlighted.":::

1. Enter the display name or email address for the user or group to add to the security group. Select the matching entry in the system, and then select **Save**. You can also add multiple accounts by separating the entries with a semicolon (**;**).

	:::image type="content" source="media/add-users/invite-members-contributors.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Invite members to security group (Contributors) dialog, choose user account to add to the group.":::

	After you save your selections, the security group **Members** list refreshes to include the new members. If you don't see the new members in the list, select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/refresh.png"::: **Refresh** to update the view. 

1. (Optional) After you add users as members of the security group, you can customize the permissions for other functionality in the project. For example, you might adjust permissions in specific [work tracking areas and iterations](set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md) or [shared queries](../../boards/queries/set-query-permissions.md#set-permissions-on-a-shared-query).

## Invite users from the Summary page 

As a member of the **Project Administrators** group, you can add members to a project from the **Summary** page and optionally add them to one or more teams. For more information, see [View and update project summary page](../../organizations/projects/project-vision-status.md).

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

	The system assigns the **Stakeholder** access level for the new user, when all of the five Basic (free) access levels are already assigned. Active contributors to a project need to have **Basic** access as a minimum.

## Add users or groups to an access level

For on-premises deployments, you might need to set the access level for a user or group, particularly if the groups don't belong to the default access level. For more information, see [Change access levels](change-access-levels.md).

## Add users or groups to SQL Server Reports

If your on-premises deployment is integrated with SQL Server Reports, you must manage membership for those products separately from their websites. For more information, see [Grant permissions to view or create SQL Server reports in Azure DevOps Server](/previous-versions/azure/devops/report/admin/grant-permissions-to-reports).
