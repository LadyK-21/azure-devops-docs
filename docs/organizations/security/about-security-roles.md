# About pipeline security roles

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

<a id="security-roles"></a>

Security for build and release pipelines, and task groups, is managed using [task-based permissions](about-permissions.md). Several pipeline resources use role-based permissions, which can be assigned to users or groups. Each role defines the operations a user can perform.

Role-based permissions apply to all resources of a specific type within a project, organization, or collection. Individual resources inherit permissions from project-level settings, but you can turn off inheritance for specific artifacts if needed.

## Default role assignments

By default, all project contributors are members of the User role for each hosted queue. This role allows them to author and run build and release pipelines using hosted queues.

## Agent pool security roles, project-level

You can add users to security roles from the project-level admin context on the **Agent Pools** page. For information on adding and managing agent pools, see [Agent pools](../../pipelines/agents/pools-queues.md).
