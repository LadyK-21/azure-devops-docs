# Change time zone

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

You can change the time zone for your organization or user profile in Azure DevOps to ensure that timestamps on work items, builds, and other activities reflect your local time. This setting helps maintain consistency and clarity across your team's activities, especially if team members are distributed across different time zones. Adjusting the time zone can be done through the organization settings or your user profile settings.

Azure DevOps offers two time zone settings:

* **Azure DevOps organization time zone**: This is the primary time zone setting. It affects all iteration dates, builds, release schedules, and other dependencies. Changing the organization time zone will impact all related schedules and timelines.
* **Azure DevOps user profile time zone**: This setting is used only for the user interface (UI) to provide a personalized experience. It displays timestamps based on the time zone configured for each specific user.

For example, if your organization time zone is set to EST and your user profile time zone is set to PST, all date and time fields will display in PST for you. For more information, see [Time zone settings and usage](../settings/timezone-settings-usage.md).
