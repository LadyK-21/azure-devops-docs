# Find or change your organization geography

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

When you [create an organization](create-organization.md) in Azure DevOps, you can choose the geography where your organization gets hosted. You might select your organization's geography based on locality, network latency, or sovereignty requirements for data centers. The default location for your organization is based on the nearest [Microsoft Azure geography](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions) where services are available.

## Find your organization geography

1. Sign in to your organization (```https://dev.azure.com/{Your_Organization}```).

2. Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/gear-icon.png" border="false"::: **Organization settings**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/settings/open-admin-settings-vert.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a gear icon and Organization settings emphasized.":::

1. Select **Overview**. The geography information is listed further down the page.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [prerequisites-organization-owner-only](../../includes/prerequisites-organization-owner-only.md)]

## Change organization geography

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can only change your organization's geography to one of the following locations:
> - Australia
> - Brazil
> - Canada
> - Asia Pacific
> - Europe
> - India
> - United Kingdom
> - United States

By default, your organization is associated with the closest geography based on your location. However, changing to a different data center (region) within the same geography isn't possible.

To change your organization geography, use [Azure DevOps Virtual Support Agent](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2160944).

We can't provide a specific time frame for your organization's relocation due to potential delays from various factors and the automated nature of the migration process. The process might get rescheduled to take place over the weekend to ensure all necessary changes are successfully completed.
