# Package and publish extensions

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Once you [develop your extension](../get-started/node.md), you can package and publish it to the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops). The Marketplace is a global repository for private and public extensions, integrations, and other offers from Microsoft.

> [!NOTE]
> For information on the discovery properties available in your extension's manifest file that helps users discover and learn about your extension, see the [Extension Manifest Reference](../develop/manifest.md#discoveryprops).

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [](./includes/before-publishing.md)]

## Create a publisher

[!INCLUDE [](./includes/create-publisher.md)]

<a id="package"></a>

## Package your extension

To upload your extension, package it as a VSIX 2.0-compatible .vsix file.
Microsoft provides a cross-platform command-line interface (CLI) to package and publish your extension. 

1. Open your extension manifest file (`vss-extension.json`) and set the value of the `publisher` field to the ID of your publisher. For example:
    
    ```json
    {
        ...
        "id": "my-first-extension",
        "publisher": "AnnetteNielsen",
        ...
    }
    ```

2. From a command prompt, run the TFX tool's packaging command from your extension directory.

   ```
   npx tfx-cli extension create
   ```

   A message displays indicating your extension is successfully packaged:

   ```
   === Completed operation: create extension ===
   - VSIX: C:\my-first-extension\AnnetteNielsen.my-first-extension-1.0.0.vsix
   - Extension ID: my-first-extension
   - Extension Version: 1.0.0
   - Publisher: AnnetteNielsen
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> Increment the version of your extension or integration in the manifest with every update. <br>
> Use the `--rev-version` command line switch. This switch increments the *patch* version number of your extension and saves the new version to your manifest.

#### Check package size

Check the size of the vsix after it gets packaged. If it's greater than 50 MB, you need to optimize it. To do so, see the following considerations:
- Deduplicate common dependencies by stating them once in the extension package.
- Fetch dependencies at runtime or during install time rather than including them in the package. Consider using the tool installer library to pull tool dependencies at runtime. This approach caches the tool by version for private agents, preventing downloads for every build. The tool installer library doesn't work in disconnected scenarios (no internet), which should be mentioned in the task description or documentation.
- Use WebPack to tree shake dependencies in tasks.

## Publish your extension

[!INCLUDE [Package_extension](../includes/procedures/publish.md)]

## Share your extension

Share your extension with an organization before you can install it in Azure DevOps. To share an extension, do the following tasks:

1. From the [Marketplace management portal](https://aka.ms/vsmarketplace-manage), select your extension from the list, right-click, and then choose **Share/Unshare** or **Publish/Unpublish**, depending on the extension.

   :::image type="content" source="../get-started/media/share-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot of menu selection, Share/Unshare.":::

1. Select **Organization**, and then enter the name of your organization. Select **Enter**.

   :::image type="content" source="../get-started/media/share-dialog.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Enter button.":::

1. Close the panel.

Your extension can now be installed into this organization.

## Install your extension

To install your shared extension, do the following steps.

1. In the Marketplace, select your extension to open its overview page.

   :::image type="content" source="../get-started/media/details-page2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Overview page.":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > Since your extension is private, only you and members of the organization it's shared with can see this page.

2. Select **Get it free** to start the installation process. Select the organization you shared the extension with from the dropdown menu.

   :::image type="content" source="../get-started/media/install-dialog.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing extension installation dialog.":::

3. Select **Install**.

Congratulations! You installed your extension into an organization and you're ready to try it.

## Try your extension

1. Select **Proceed to organization** at the end of the installation wizard to go to the home page of the organization the extension was installed to (`https://dev.azure.com/{organization}`).
2. Refresh your browser.
3. Open **Organization settings**, and then select **Extensions**.

   :::image type="content" source="../get-started/media/organization-settings-extensions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Organization settings, Extensions page.":::

You should see the new extension on the **Installed** tab.

## Debug your extension

To debug the extension using Visual Studio or Browser Developer Tools, change the manifest by adding the `baseUri` property. This action speeds up the development without the need to redeploy the extension each time you change source code.

```json
{
    ...
    "baseUri": "https://localhost:44300",
    ...
}
```

When you change the manifest, it loads the extension from your local web server instance. For example, IISExpress in Visual Studio.
After you change the manifest, deploy and install this debugging extension only once.

> [!NOTE]
> Run your local web server in SSL mode because Azure DevOps demands that the web page is served from a secure source. Otherwise, you get an error in the browser console during the extension IFRAME loading.

## Update your extension

[!INCLUDE [Update_extension](../includes/procedures/update.md)]

## Make your extension public

While you develop your extension or integration for the Marketplace, keep it private. This limits the visibility of the extension to specific accounts that you have shared it with.

To make your extension available publicly, set the [public flag](../develop/manifest.md#public-flag) to `true` in your manifest.

### Qualifications

To have a public listing on the Marketplace, your integration or extension must meet the following qualifications:

- Works with or extends Azure DevOps.
- You, or your company, own, develop, and are licensed to distribute and advertise the integration or extension.
- The extension or integration is actively maintained.

Microsoft might also request a demo and to review the content planned for your Marketplace entry.

## Top Publisher 

The Top Publisher program is only available for publishers with Azure DevOps extensions or integrations. It's not applicable for Visual Studio IDE and Visual Studio Code extension publishers.

:::image type="content" source="media/top-publisher.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Top Publisher badge.":::

The Top Publisher program  recognizes publishers with commitment to their customers and the Marketplace through exemplary policies, quality, reliability, and support. Once you become a Top Publisher, all of your public offerings display the Top Publisher badge.

### Top Publisher requirements

The Top Publisher program in the Marketplace is designed to help you evaluate or acquire Azure DevOps extensions and integrations with confidence. The Top Publisher badge implies that the publisher shows commitment to their customers and the Marketplace through exemplary policies, quality, reliability, and support. It's for publishers with one or more global Azure DevOps extensions or integrations and isn't applicable for Visual Studio IDE and Visual Studio Code extension publishers.

Marketplace assigns the badge to a publisher after carefully reviewing the publisher across the following parameters:

- Privacy policy
- Licensing policy
- Support policy
- Documentation
- Q & A responsiveness
- Ratings and reviews for their offerings
- Active uptake and install count for their offerings
- Management of at least one public extension for Azure DevOps
- Public extension with more than 5,000 installs and an active install count exceeding 1000

You can expect timely support and a good overall experience when you get an extension from a Top Publisher. Check out the offerings from the Top Publishers.

For more information on adding policies to your offering, see the [extension manifest](../develop/manifest.md).

1. Update your publisher profile.

   Through the publisher profile, you can showcase all of your offerings in one place along with key publisher-related information. To provide the information, which shows up in the profile, do the following steps:

    a. Sign in to https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers using the account with which you publish and manage your offerings in the Visual Studio Marketplace.
    
    b. Select the publisher and complete the **About you** section in the **Details** tab.
     :::image type="content" source="media/microsoft-about-you-section.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the section about you for Microsoft publishers.":::
    c. Save your changes and select **View profile** to see how it appears to consumers. You can use this profile page to evangelize your offerings.

> [!NOTE]
> This program certifies the publisher, not the software, or security of their extensions and integrations. We recommend reviewing the [safety information](../overview.md#safety-information) when evaluating offerings from a publisher. If you got an extension from a Top Publisher and aren't satisfied with your experience, consider engaging with the publisher first.

## Apply to be a Top Publisher

1. Sign in to [Marketplace management portal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers) using the account with which you publish and manage your offerings in Marketplace.
2. Select the publisher and go to its **Top Publisher** tab. Have one or more global Azure DevOps (Server/Service) extensions or integrations for the tab to appear.
3. If you meet the previously listed requirements and are the publisher's owner, you can apply for the program. Upon application, an email gets sent to the Marketplace team to review your case. They respond within 10 business days with next steps, clarifying questions, or the grant of the badge.

The team likely considers other parameters, such as active uptake of your offerings, install/get started counts, and ratings & reviews across your offerings before granting the badge. Microsoft reserves the right to grant, reject, or revoke the Top Publisher badge at any time.

Once a publisher is a Top Publisher, all its future updates and offerings must meet the previously listed requirements.

## Respond to Marketplace extension reviews

You can respond to reviews that customers leave for your extensions in the Visual Studio Marketplace. Find and select **Reply** next to a review if you have one of the following permissions: owner, creator, or contributor.

You can leave only one response. Avoid using reviews as a support forum. If you need more details, please provide a support alias for the reviewer to contact. You can then resolve their problems externally and update your reply with a resolution.

### Guidelines for publisher responses

Keep the Visual Studio Marketplace an open, inviting, respectful, and helpful place for customers to find, try, install, and review extensions. Communication plays an important role in keeping a healthy community. To help create this environment, here are guidelines for publishers responding to customer reviews. Think deeply about your customer interactions and reflect on the spirit of the customer experience that the Marketplace is trying to create.

- Reserve reviews for customer comments. Use *Reply* only to respond to a review.
- Respect all customer opinions. Treat comments as feedback without debate, criticism, or argument.
- Ensure your responses add value and are relevant to your customers' comments.
- Focus on precisely addressing questions or problems. If you need more details, ask the customer to contact you over email rather than discussing in reviews. When you resolve the problem, update your reply with the resolution. You can edit your reply like customers can edit their reviews.
- Flag any inappropriate reviews, such as spam, abusive, or offensive content, for our review.

## Request to void a review

As a publisher, you can appeal to void a review if the issue reported is because of the Marketplace or underlying platform. If the issue is valid, Marketplace admins void the rating. You can **Appeal** from ratings and review section on your extension hub page.

## Unpublish an extension

You can unpublish free extensions if you no longer want to offer them in the Marketplace.

Consider removing your extension from the Marketplace in the following scenarios:
- You developed a new extension and no longer want to offer the current one.
- Your extension has a problem, and you want to remove it from the Marketplace until you resolve the issue.
- You published your extension as public by mistake.

Certain criteria must be met for an extension to be unpublished or removed:

| Action    | Requirements                                                  |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unpublish | Only **free extensions** might be unpublished.                  |
| Remove    | Your extension must have **zero (0)** installs to be removed. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you must remove your extension because of legal or security problems, contact [Customer Support at the Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/AzureDevOps). We review the request and manually delete the extension. 

1. Select the extension on your [publisher page](https://aka.ms/vsmarketplace-manage) and choose **Unpublish** on the menu. 

   Your extension is unpublished immediately from the Marketplace, and new users can't install it. Ratings and reviews for your extension stay intact. 

To offer your extension again in the Marketplace, select **Publish** from the menu.

If your extension has zero installs, you can choose to remove it completely from the Marketplace. To do so, select **Remove** from the menu. You can't reverse this action.

<a id="extension-report">  </a>

## Extension reporting hub

Once your extension is available in the Visual Studio Marketplace, you can use the **Reports** feature. With this feature, you can track and analyze how the extension is performing and take required actions. 
To visit the extension hub, browse to your [publisher page](https://aka.ms/vsmarketplace-manage) and select the extension or select the **Reports** link on the extension details page.

### Acquisition 

You can view acquisition-related data in this tab for the selected period. 
* Aggregated acquisition in the selected period for overall acquisition
* Aggregated acquisition split by extension downloads Azure DevOps connected install for free extension
* Aggregated acquisition split by trials Azure DevOps connected buy for paid extension
* Daily trend of extension page views with acquisition for Azure DevOps and connected server
* Conversion percentage from page views to acquisition

For paid extensions, all transactional details for buy and trials are available with date, organization name, trial end date, and quantity. You can use the **Contact** action to communicate with your users. For more information, see the [Contact](#contact) section provided later in this article. 

### Uninstall

You can view the following statistics:
- How many organizations uninstalled your extension
- Daily trend of uninstall extensions
- Detailed feedback shared during uninstalls
- Top uninstall reasons

You can use search for text and dates to analyze and draw more insights from the detailed feedback. 

For paid extensions, you can use the **Contact** action to communicate with your users. [Contact](#contact) section provided later in this article for more details.

### Ratings and review

This tab gives you the following information:
- Average rating for the selected period versus overall rating
- Average rating by number of reviewers
- Daily trend of average rating

The details section provides all the reviews and your responses in transactional view. 

You can **Reply** to a review or **Edit** a previous response and better manage engagement with your extension users. You can also **Appeal** to void a rating if the issue reported is because of the Marketplace or underlying platform. If the issue is valid, we void the rating. 

### Manage engagement

The Q & A tab provides a snapshot of all questions from your extension users, with nonresponded queries at the top. You can reply to or edit previous responses to better manage engagement with your extension users.

### Export to Excel

All data elements available in the reports page are also available for download in XLS format to aid creating your own custom reports. 

### Contact

For paid extensions, you can use the **Contact** action to communicate with your users. This feature is available only for publishers with Contributor+ access on the extension.

Marketplace brokers the first communication with the user as our privacy policy doesn't allow direct sharing of customer email addresses. Only users who opted in for communication receive the email. The last contacted date for an organization is updated after sending a communication.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow the guidance on transactional and promotional communication. Publishers found to be sending promotional communication or spamming users get added to a blocklist and lose access to the **Contact** feature for all their extensions.

**Transactional communication**: Emails conveying critical information necessary for the continued use of the extension or service, such as:
- Critical security notices
- Transaction confirmations
- Product recall notices
- Specific feedback requests
- Service discontinuation notices

**Promotional emails**: Emails used to market your extension, product, service, website, or event, such as:
- Invitations to events or webcasts
- Information about new marketing or partner programs
- Offers to obtain value-added content
- Newsletters containing promotional content

For more information, see  the [Marketplace Publisher Agreement](https://aka.ms/vsmarketplace-agreement).
