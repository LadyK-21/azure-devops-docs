# Get started with the REST APIs

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Azure DevOps REST APIs provide powerful programmatic access to work items, repositories, builds, releases, and more. Whether you're building custom integrations, automating workflows, or extending Azure DevOps capabilities, understanding the fundamental patterns and concepts is essential for successful implementation.

> [!TIP]
> Ready to start coding? Skip to [REST API samples](../get-started/rest/samples.md) for complete working examples with modern authentication patterns.

This article covers the fundamental concepts and patterns for Azure DevOps REST APIs. For practical implementation examples, see [REST API samples](../get-started/rest/samples.md).

## URL structure

The APIs follow a common pattern, as shown in the following example:

```no-highlight
VERB https://{instance}/{collection}/{team-project}/_apis/{area}/{resource}?api-version={version}
```

> [!TIP]
> As APIs evolve, we recommend that you include an API version in every request. This practice can help you avoid unexpected changes in the API that could break.

### Azure DevOps Services

For Azure DevOps Services, `instance` is `dev.azure.com/{organization}` and `collection` is `DefaultCollection`, so the pattern looks like the following example:

```no-highlight
VERB https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/_apis/{area}/{resource}?api-version={version}
```

**Example endpoint:**
```no-highlight
GET https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/_apis/projects?api-version=7.2
```

### Azure DevOps Server

For Azure DevOps Server, `instance` is `{server:port}`. The default port for a non-SSL connection is 8080.

The default collection is `DefaultCollection`, but you can use any collection.

**Examples:**
- SSL: `https://{server}/DefaultCollection/_apis/projects?api-version=7.2`
- Non-SSL: `http://{server}:8080/DefaultCollection/_apis/projects?api-version=7.2`

## Authentication

Azure DevOps REST APIs support several authentication methods:

- **Microsoft Entra ID** - Recommended for production applications
- **Personal Access Tokens (PATs)** - Simple authentication for scripts and testing  
- **OAuth 2.0** - For non-Microsoft applications
- **Service principals** - For automated scenarios

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Entra ID authentication is the recommended approach for production applications. For implementation examples and complete authentication guidance, see [REST API samples](../get-started/rest/samples.md) and [Authentication guidance](../get-started/authentication/authentication-guidance.md).

## Response format

Azure DevOps REST APIs typically return JSON responses. Here's an example response structure:

```json
{
    "value": [
        {
            "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
            "name": "Fabrikam-Fiber-TFVC",
            "url": "https://dev.azure.com/fabrikam-fiber-inc/_apis/projects/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
            "description": "TeamFoundationVersionControlprojects"
        }
    ],
    "count": 1
}
```

The response is [JSON](https://json.org/), which is generally what you get back from the REST APIs, although there are a few exceptions, like [Git blobs](/rest/api/azure/devops/git/blobs).

> [!TIP]
> For complete working examples showing how to parse these responses, see [REST API samples](../get-started/rest/samples.md).

## HTTP methods and operations

Azure DevOps REST APIs use standard HTTP methods:

| Method | Used for... | Example |
|:-------|:------------|:--------|
| GET    | Get a resource or list of resources | Get projects, work items |
| POST   | Create a resource, or get resources using advanced queries | Create work items, query work items |
| PUT    | Create or completely replace a resource | Create/update work item |
| PATCH  | Update specific fields of a resource | Update work item fields |
| DELETE | Delete a resource | Delete work item |

> [!TIP]
> For practical examples of each HTTP method with complete code samples, see [REST API samples](../get-started/rest/samples.md).

### Request headers and content

When you provide a request body (usually with POST, PUT, and PATCH), include appropriate headers:

```http
Content-Type: application/json
```

For PATCH operations on work items, use:

```http
Content-Type: application/json-patch+json
```

### HTTP method override

Some web proxies might only support the HTTP verbs GET and POST, but not more modern HTTP verbs like PATCH and DELETE.
If your calls might pass through one of these proxies, you can send the actual verb using a POST method, with a header to override the method.
For example, you might want to [update a work item](/rest/api/azure/devops/wit/work-items/update) (`PATCH _apis/wit/workitems/3`), but you might have to go through a proxy that only allows GET or POST.
You can pass the proper verb (PATCH in this case) as an HTTP request header parameter and use POST as the actual HTTP method.

```no-highlight
POST https://dev.azure.com/fabrikam-fiber-inc/_apis/wit/workitems/3
```

```http
X-HTTP-Method-Override: PATCH
```

```json
{
   (PATCH request body)
}
```

## Response codes

Understanding HTTP response codes helps you handle API responses appropriately:

| Response | Meaning | Notes |
|:---------|:--------|:------|
| 200      | Success | Response body contains requested data |
| 201      | Created | Resource successfully created |
| 204      | Success | No response body (common with DELETE) |
| 400      | Bad Request | Invalid parameters or request body |
| 401      | Unauthorized | Authentication failed or missing |
| 403      | Forbidden | User lacks permission for operation |
| 404      | Not Found | Resource doesn't exist or no permission to view |
| 409      | Conflict | Request conflicts with current resource state |

## API versioning

Azure DevOps REST APIs are versioned to ensure applications continue working as APIs evolve.

### Guidelines

* **Always specify the API version** with every request (**required**)
* Format API versions as: `{major}.{minor}` or `{major}.{minor}-{stage}` (for example, `7.2`, `7.2-preview`)
* Use specific preview revisions when available: `7.2-preview.1`, `7.2-preview.2`
* Upgrade to released versions when preview APIs are deprecated

### Usage

Specify the API version as a URL query parameter:

```no-highlight
GET https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/_apis/projects?api-version=7.2
```

Or in the request header:

```http
Accept: application/json;api-version=7.2
```

For supported versions, see [REST API versioning](../concepts/rest-api-versioning.md#supported-versions).
