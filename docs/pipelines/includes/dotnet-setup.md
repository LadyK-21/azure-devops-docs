If you don't have a .NET project to work with, create a new one on your local machine as follows:

1. Install the [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0), or make sure you have it installed.
1. Open a terminal window on your local machine.
1. Create a project directory and navigate to it.
1. Create a new .NET 8 web app by running `dotnet new webapp -f net8.0`.
1. Build and run the application locally by using [`dotnet run`](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run).
1. When the application starts, press Ctrl+C to shut it down.
1. Upload or connect the local project to your GitHub repository.
