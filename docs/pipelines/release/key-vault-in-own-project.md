# Use Azure Key Vault secrets in your Pipeline

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2019](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2019.md)]

Azure Key Vaults enable developers to securely store and manage sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and certificates. This article walks you through how to query and use secrets from an Azure Key Vault in your pipeline.

## Prerequisites

| **Product** | **Requirements**   |
|-------------|--------------------|
| **Azure DevOps** | - An [Azure DevOps project](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md).<br>   - **Permissions:**<br>      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- To grant access to all pipelines in the project: You must be a member of the [Project Administrators group](../../organizations/security/change-project-level-permissions.md).<br>      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- To create service connections: You must have the *Administrator* or *Creator* role for [service connections](../library/add-resource-protection.md). |
| **GitHub** | - A [GitHub](https://github.com) account and a [GitHub repository](../../repos/git/create-new-repo.md). <br>   - A [GitHub service connection](../library/service-endpoints.md#github-service-connection) to authorize Azure Pipelines.|
| **Azure** | - An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). |

## Create a Key Vault

### [Azure portal](#tab/portal/)

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), and then select **Create a resource**.

1. Under **Key Vault**, select **Create** to create a new Azure Key Vault.

1. Select your **Subscription** from the dropdown menu, and then select an existing **Resource group** or create a new one. Enter a **Key vault name**, select a **Region**, choose a **Pricing tier**, and select **Next** if you want to configure additional properties. Otherwise, select **Review + create** to keep the default settings.

1. Once the deployment is complete, select **Go to resource**.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/cli/)

1. First, set your default region and Azure subscription:

    - Set default subscription:
    
    ```azurecli
    az account set --subscription <your_subscription_name_or_subscription_ID>
    ```

    - Set default region:
    
    ```azurecli
    az config set defaults.location=<your_region>
    ```

1. Create a new resource group to host your Azure Key Vault. A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution:

    ```azurecli
    az group create --name <your-resource-group>
    ```
   
1. Create a new Azure Key Vault:

    ```azurecli
    az keyvault create \
      --name <your-key-vault-name> \
      --resource-group <your-resource-group>
    ```

# [Service Principal](#tab/serviceprincipal)

## Create a service principal

In this step, you'll create a new [service principal](/cli/azure/azure-cli-sp-tutorial-1) in Azure so that your Azure Pipelines can access Azure Key Vault.

1. Navigate to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), then select the **>_** icon from the top menu to open the **Cloud Shell**.

1. Select either **PowerShell** or **Bash** depending on your preference. 

1. Run the following command to create a new service principal:

    ```Azure CLI
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name YOUR_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME
    ```

1. After the command runs, you’ll get an output similar to the following. Copy and save the output, you’ll need it to create a service connection in the next step. 

    ```json
    {
      "appId": "00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444",
      "displayName": "MyServicePrincipal",
      "password": "***********************************",
      "tenant": "aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee"
    }
    ```

## Create a service connection

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization, and then navigate to your project.

1. Select **Project settings**, and then select **Service connections**.

1. Select **New service connection**, select **Azure Resource Manager**, and then select **Next**.

1. Select **Service principal (manual)**, and then select **Next**.

1. Under **Identity Type**, select **App registration or managed identity (manual)**.

1. Under **Credential**, select **Workload identity federation**.

1. Provide a name for your service connection, and then select **Next**.

1. Copy the **Issuer** and the **Subject identifier** values. You'll need them in the next step.

1. For **Environment**, Select **Azure Cloud** and for **Subscription scope** select **Subscription**.

1. Enter your Azure **Subscription ID** and **Subscription name**.

1. Under **Authentication**, paste your service principal's **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**

1. In the **Security** section, check the **Grant access permission to all pipelines** box to allow all pipelines to use this service connection. If you skip this, you’ll need to manually grant access per pipeline.

1. Leave this page open, you’ll come back to complete it after you've (1) created the federated credential in Azure and (2) granted your service principal *Read* access at the subscription level.

## Add role assignment to your subscription

Before you can verify the connection, you need to grant the service principal **Read** access at the subscription level:

1. Navigate to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

1. Under **Azure services**, select **Subscriptions**, and then find and select your subscription.

1. Select **Access control (IAM)**, and then select **Add** > **Add role assignment**.

1. Under the **Role** tab, select **Reader**, and then select **Next**.

1. Select **User, group, or service principal**, and then select **Select members**. 

1. In the search bar, paste your service principal's *Object ID*, select it, then click **Select**.
 
1. Select **Review + assign**, review your settings, and then select **Review + assign** again to confirm.

1. Once the role assignment is added. go back to your service connection in Azure DevOps and select **Verify and Save** to save your service connection.

## Configure Key Vault access policies

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), find the key vault you created earlier, and then select **Access policies**.

1. Select **Create**, then under **Secret permissions** add both the **Get** and **List** permissions, and then select **Next**.

1. Under **Principal**, paste your service principal's *Object ID*, select it, and then select **Next**.

1. Select **Next** again, review your settings, and then select **Save** to apply the new policy.

## Query and use secrets in your pipeline

Using the [Azure Key Vault task](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/azure-key-vault-v2), you can now query and fetch secrets from Azure Key Vault and use them in subsequent tasks in your pipeline. Note that secrets must be explicitly mapped to environment variables, as shown in the following example:

```YAML
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- task: AzureKeyVault@2                                # Download Azure Key Vault secrets.
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: 'SERVICE_CONNECTION_NAME'       # Name of the service connection. Alias: ConnectedServiceName.
    KeyVaultName: 'KEY_VAULT_NAME'                     # Name of the key vault.
    SecretsFilter: '*'                                 # Secrets filter. Default: *.

- bash: |
    echo "Secret Found! $MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR"        
  env:
    MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR: $(SECRET_NAME)
```

The output from the last bash step should look like this:

```
Secret Found! ***
```

> [!NOTE]
> To query multiple secrets from your Azure Key Vault, use the `SecretsFilter` input and provide a comma-separated list of secret names, like: *'secret1, secret2'*.
