# Integrate Azure Pipelines with ServiceNow change management

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

To improve collaboration between development and IT teams, Azure Pipelines supports integration with ServiceNow. Teams can reduce the risks associated with changes and follow service management methodologies such as Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) by including change management gates in release pipelines.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Configure ServiceNow instances.
> - Include the ServiceNow change management process as a release gate.
> - Monitor the change management process from release pipelines.
> - Keep ServiceNow change requests updated with deployment results.

## Prerequisites 

- Have a HI account in a nondeveloper instance of [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/).
- Have an Azure DevOps [organization](../../../organizations/accounts/create-organization.md) and [project](../../../organizations/projects/create-project.md) with organization-level permissions to install extensions.
- Have either a [Classic release pipeline](../define-multistage-release-process.md), or a [YAML pipeline](../../create-first-pipeline.md) that deploys to an environment, in your Azure DevOps project.
- Make sure you understand and can follow the procedures in [Use gates and approvals to control your deployment](../deploy-using-approvals.md) and [Define approvals and checks](../../process/approvals.md).

## Configure the ServiceNow instance

1. Install the [Azure Pipelines extension](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/fa788cb5dbb5630040669c27db961940) on your ServiceNow instance. See [Buying Overview](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/help?article=KB0010019) for more details on installing apps from the ServiceNow store. You need **HI** credentials to complete the installation.

1. In ServiceNow, create a new user for the Azure Pipelines Service Account and grant it the **x_mioms_azpipeline.pipelinesExecution** role.

   :::image type="content" source="media/servicenow-01.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to set up a new user in ServiceNow.":::

## Set up the Azure DevOps organization and project

1. In your Azure DevOps organization, install the [ServiceNow Change Management extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscs-rm.vss-services-servicenowchangerequestmanagement).

   :::image type="content" source="media/servicenow-02.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the ServiceNow Change Management extension.":::

1. In your Azure DevOps project, create a new ServiceNow service connection by using either **Basic authentication** or [OAuth2 authentication](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-extensions/blob/master/Extensions/ServiceNow/Src/readme.md#create-service-connection-for-servicenow-in-azure-pipelines). For more information, see [Create a service connection](../../library/service-endpoints.md#create-a-service-connection).

   :::image type="content" source="media/servicenow-03.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to configure ServiceNow service connection.":::

## Configure the pipeline

You can add ServiceNow integration to a Classic release pipeline or to a YAML pipeline that deploys to an environment.

#### [Classic](#tab/classic/)

### Add the ServiceNow Change Management pre-deployment gate

1. In your Azure Pipelines release pipeline, select the **Pre-deployment conditions** icon.

1. On the **Pre-deployment conditions** screen, expand and enable **Gates**, select **Add** next to **Deployment gates**, and select the **ServiceNow Change Management** pre-deployment gate.

   :::image type="content" source="media/servicenow-04.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to add a pre-deployment gate.":::

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)

### Add the ServiceNow Change Management check

1. In your Azure DevOps project, select **Pipelines** > **Environments** in the left menu, and select the environment that your YAML pipeline deploys to.

1. On the **Approvals and checks** tab, select **+** to add a new check, and then select and add the **ServiceNow Change Management** check to your environment.

    :::image type="content" source="media/servicenow-12.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to add a ServiceNow Change Management check.":::

---

### Configure ServiceNow Change Management settings

1. On the **ServiceNow Change Management** settings screen, under **ServiceNow connection**, select the ServiceNow service connection you created earlier.

   :::image type="content" source="media/servicenow-05.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to configure the ServiceNow Change Management gate.":::

1. Complete the rest of the form as follows:

   |Setting|Description|
   |-------|-----------|
   | **Action** | Select **Create new change request** or **Use existing change request**.
   | **Change type** | Select **Normal**, **Standard**, or **Emergency**.
   | **Short description** | Enter a summary of the change.|
   | **Schedule of change request** | Optionally, enter the schedule of the change as honored by the ServiceNow workflow. Under **Planned start date** and **Planned end date**, enter UTC date and time in format *yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ*.|
   | **Description** | Optionally, enter a detailed description of the change.|
   | **Category** | Optionally select the category of the change, such as **Hardware**, **Network**, or **Software**.|
   | **Priority** | Optionally select the priority of the change.|
   | **Risk** | Optionally select the risk level for the change.|
   | **Impact** | Optionally select the effect that the change has on business.|
   | **Configuration item** | Optionally select the configuration item that the change applies to.|
   | **Assignment group** |  Optionally select the group that the change is assigned to.|
   | **Advanced** > **Additional change request parameters** | Select the ellipsis next to the field and then select **Add** to add more parameters. Names must be field names, not labels, prefixed with `u_`, such as `u_backout_plan`. Values must be valid in ServiceNow. Invalid entries are ignored.|
   | **Success criteria** | Select either **Desired state of change request** or **Advanced success criteria**.
   | **Desired state of change request** | Select the change request status value necessary for the gate to succeed and the pipeline to continue.
   | **Advanced success criteria** | Enter an expression that controls when the gate should succeed. The change request is defined as `root['result']` in the response from ServiceNow. For example, `and(eq(root['result'].state, 'New'),eq(root['result'].risk, 'Low'))`. For more information, see [Expressions](../../process/expressions.md).
   | **Output Variables** > **Reference name** | To be able to use output variables in your deployment workflow, specify a reference name. You can access gate variables by using `PREDEPLOYGATE` as a prefix in an agentless job. For example, when the reference name is set to *gate1*, you can get the change request number by using the variable `$(PREDEPLOYGATE.gate1.CHANGE_REQUEST_NUMBER)`.
   | **Variables list** | **CHANGE_REQUEST_NUMBER** is the number of the change request.<br> **CHANGE_SYSTEM_ID** is the System ID of the change request.|

#### [Classic](#tab/classic/)

### Update the pipeline

1. At the end of your release pipeline, add an **Agentless job** with the task **Update ServiceNow Change Request**.
1. In the task settings form, under **ServiceNow connection**, select your ServiceNow service connection.
1. Under **Change request number**, enter the ServiceNow change request number to update.
1. Select **Update status**, and then under **Updated status of change request**, choose or enter the status to set for the change request.
1. In **Work Notes** under **Advanced**, optionally enter any work notes to be added for the change request update.

    :::image type="content" source="media/servicenow-06.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to configure the Update ServiceNow Change Request task.":::

> [!NOTE]
> The Update ServiceNow Change Request task fails if none of the change request fields are updated during execution. ServiceNow ignores invalid fields and values passed to the task.

## Create a release

Select **Create release** to start a new release.

Your pipeline should create a new change request in ServiceNow as part of the pre-deployment conditions you created earlier.

:::image type="content" source="media/servicenow-07.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the execution of the pre-deployment gate.":::

The pipeline waits for all the gates to succeed within the same sample interval. To check the change number, select the status icon to view your pipeline logs.

:::image type="content" source="media/servicenow-08.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the pipeline logs.":::

The change request is queued in ServiceNow, and the change owner can view it.

:::image type="content" source="media/servicenow-09.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing a new change request in ServiceNow.":::
   
You can find the release pipeline that triggered the new change request under the **Azure DevOps Pipeline metadata** section.

:::image type="content" source="media/servicenow-10.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the release pipeline metadata.":::

When the change is ready for implementation and moved to **Implement** state, the pipeline resumes execution and the gate status should return **succeeded**.

:::image type="content" source="media/servicenow-11.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the deployment gate status.":::

The change request closes automatically after deployment.

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)

### Add the YAML task

To update the change request, add the following [server job](../../process/phases.md#server-jobs) and `UpdateServiceNowChangeRequest@2` task to your YAML pipeline.

```yaml
stages:
- stage: Stage1
  jobs:
  - deployment: DeployLatest
    environment: <environment-name>
  ...
  - job: UpdateChangeRequest
    steps:
    - task: UpdateServiceNowChangeRequest@2
      displayName: 'Update ServiceNow Change Request'
      inputs:
        ServiceNowConnection: '<service-connection-name>'
        NewStatus: '<status-to-set>'
        WorkNotes: '<work-notes-for-change-request>'
        otherParameters: '{"u_<field-name>": "<valid-value>"}'
pool: server
```

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/servicenow-13.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the agentless task.":::

## Run the pipeline

Save and run your pipeline. A new change request is automatically created, and the pipeline pauses and waits for the checks to complete. When the checks complete, the pipeline resumes execution.

:::image type="content" source="media/servicenow-14.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the pipeline execution.":::

The change request closes automatically after deployment.
