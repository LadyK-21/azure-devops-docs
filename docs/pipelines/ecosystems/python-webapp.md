# Use Azure Pipelines to build and deploy a Python web app to Azure App Service

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Use Azure Pipelines for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) to build and deploy a Python web app to Azure App Service on Linux. Your pipeline automatically builds and deploys your Python web app to App Service whenever there's a commit to the repository.

In this article, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a web app in Azure App Service.
> * Create a project in Azure DevOps.
> * Connect your DevOps project to Azure.
> * Create a Python-specific pipeline.
> * Run the pipeline to build and deploy your app to your web app in App Service.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [ecosystems-prerequisites](includes/ecosystems-prerequisites.md)]

## Create a repository for your app code

Fork the sample repository at [https://github.com/Microsoft/python-sample-vscode-flask-tutorial](https://github.com/Microsoft/python-sample-vscode-flask-tutorial) to your GitHub account.

On your local host, clone your GitHub repository. Use the following command, replacing `<repository-url>` with the URL of your forked repository.

   ```git
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

### Test your app locally

Build and run the app locally to make sure it works.

1. Change to the cloned repository folder.

   ```bash
   cd python-sample-vscode-flask-tutorial
   ```

1. Build and run the app

    # [Linux](#tab/linux)
    
    ```bash
    python -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r ./requirements.txt
    export set FLASK_APP=hello_app.webapp
    python3 -m flask run
    ```
    
    # [PowerShell](#tab/windows-powershell)
    
    ```powershell
    py -m venv .env
    .env\scripts\activate
    pip install -r ./requirements.txt
    $env:FLASK_APP = "hello_app.webapp"
    flask run
    ```
    
    ---

1. To view the app, open a browser window and go to *http://localhost:5000*. Verify that you see the title `Visual Studio Flask Tutorial`. 

1. When you're finished, close the browser window and stop the Flask server with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.

### Open a Cloud Shell

1. Sign in to the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Open the Azure CLI by selecting the Cloud Shell button on the portal toolbar.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/python/azure-cloud-shell-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Cloud Shell button on the Azure portal toolbar.":::

1. The Cloud Shell appears along the bottom of the browser. Select **Bash** from the dropdown menu.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/python/azure-cloud-shell-interface.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Cloud Shell.":::

1. To give you more space to work, select the maximize button.

### Create an Azure App Service web app

Create your Azure App Service web app from the Cloud Shell in the Azure portal. 

> [!TIP]
> To paste into the Cloud Shell, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> or right-click and select **Paste** from the context menu.

1. Clone your repository with the following command, replacing `<repository-url>` with the URL of your forked repository.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

1. Change directory to the cloned repository folder, so the `az webapp up` command recognizes the app as a Python app.

   ```bash
   cd python-sample-vscode-flask-tutorial
   ```

1. Use the [az webapp up](/cli/azure/webapp#az-webapp-up) command to both provision the App Service and do the first deployment of your app. Replace `<your-web-app-name>` with a name that is unique across Azure. Typically, you use a personal or company name along with an app identifier, such as `<your-name>-flaskpipelines`. The app URL becomes *\<your-appservice>.azurewebsites.net*.

   ```azurecli
   az webapp up --name <your-web-app-name>
   ```

    The JSON output of the `az webapp up` command shows:

    ```json
    {
      "URL": <your-web-app-url>,
      "appserviceplan": <your-app-service-plan-name>,
      "location": <your-azure-location>,
      "name": <your-web-app-name>,
      "os": "Linux",
      "resourcegroup": <your-resource-group>,
      "runtime_version": "python|3.11",
      "runtime_version_detected": "-",
      "sku": <sku>,
      "src_path": <repository-source-path>
    }
    ```

     Note the `URL` and the `runtime_version` values. You use the `runtime_version` in the pipeline YAML file. The `URL` is the URL of your web app. You can use it to verify that the app is running.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The `az webapp up` command does the following actions:
    >
    >* Create a default [resource group](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create).
    >
    >* Create a default [App Service plan](/cli/azure/appservice/plan#az-appservice-plan-create).
    >
    >* [Create an app](/cli/azure/webapp#az-webapp-create) with the specified name.
    >
    >* [Zip deploy](/azure/app-service/deploy-zip) all files from the current working directory, with build automation enabled.
    >
    >* Cache the parameters locally in the *.azure/config* file so that you don't need to specify them again when deploying later with `az webapp up` or other `az webapp` commands from the project folder. The cached values are used automatically by default.
    >
    > You can override the default action with your own values using the command parameters.  For more information, see [az webapp up](/cli/azure/webapp#az-webapp-up).

1. The *python-sample-vscode-flask-tutorial* app has a *startup.txt* file that contains the specific startup command for the web app. Set the web app `startup-file` configuration property to `startup.txt`.

    1. From the `az webapp up` command output, copy the `resourcegroup` value.

    1. Enter the following command, using the resource group and your app name.  

      ```azurecli
      az webapp config set --resource-group <your-resource-group> --name <your-web-app-name> --startup-file startup.txt
      ```

      When the command completes, it shows JSON output that contains all of the configuration settings for your web app.

1. To see the running app, open a browser and go to the `URL` shown in the `az webapp up` command output. If you see a generic page, wait a few seconds for the App Service to start, then refresh the page. Verify that you see the title `Visual Studio Flask Tutorial`.

## Create an Azure DevOps project

## Create a service principal

A service principal is an identity created for use with applications, hosted services, and automated tools to access Azure resources. This access is restricted to the roles assigned to the service principal, giving you control over which resources can be accessed and at which level.

To create a service principal, go to cloud shell (bash) and run the following command. Replace  `<service-principal-name>` with a name for your service principal, `<your-subscription-id>` with your subscription ID, and `<your-resource-group>` with the resource group for the web app.

```azurecli
az ad sp create-for-rbac --display-name <service-principal-name> --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/<your-subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<your-resource-group>
```

The command returns a JSON object similar to the following example:

```json
{
  "clientId": "<client GUID>",
  "clientSecret": "<string-value>",
  "subscriptionId": "<subscription GUID>",
  "tenantId": "<tenant GUID>",
  ...
}
```

Make note of the `clientId`, `clientSecret`, `subscriptionId`, and `tenantId` values. You need these values to create a service connection in the next section.

::: moniker-end

## Create a service connection

A service connection allows you to create a connection to provide authenticated access from Azure Pipelines to external and remote services. To deploy to your Azure App Service web app, create a service connection to the resource group containing the web app.

## Configure a self-hosted agent

If you're using your own self-hosted agent, you need to configure the agent to run Python. Downloading Python versions isn't supported on self-hosted agents. You must preinstall the Python version. Use the full installer to get a pip-compatible version of Python. 

To avoid incompatible issues, you should match the Python version with the runtime version on your Azure App Services web app. The runtime version is shown in the JSON output of the `az webapp up` command.

The desired Python version needs to be added to the tool cache on the self-hosted agent so the task can use it. Normally, the tool cache is located under the _work/_tool directory of the agent; alternatively, the path can be overridden with the environment variable AGENT_TOOLSDIRECTORY. Under the tools directory, create the following directory structure based on of your Python version:

```console
$AGENT_TOOLSDIRECTORY/
    Python/
        {version number}/
            {platform}/
                {tool files}
            {platform}.complete
```

The version number should follow the format of 1.2.3. The platform should either be x86 or x64. The tool files should be the unzipped Python version files. The `{platform}.complete` should be a 0-byte file that looks like `x86.complete` or `x64.complete` and just signifies the tool is properly installed in the cache.

For example, if you're using Python 3.11 on a 64-bit Windows machine, the directory structure would look like this:

```console
$AGENT_TOOLSDIRECTORY/
    Python/
        3.11.4/
            x64/
                {python files}
            x64.complete
```

If you already have the Python version you want to use on the machine hosting your agent, you can copy the files to the tool cache. If you don't have the Python version, you can download it from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

#### Build stage

::: moniker range=">=azure-devops"

The build stage contains a single job that runs on the operating system defined in the vmImageName variable.

```yml
  - job: BuildJob
    pool:
      vmImage: $(vmImageName)
```

::: moniker-end


::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

The build stage contains a single job that runs on an agent in the pool identified by the name parameter. You can specify the agent capabilities with the `demands` keyword. For example, `demands: python` specifies that the agent must have Python installed. To specify a self-hosted agent by name, you can use the `demands: Agent.Name -equals <agent-name>` keyword.

```yml
  - job: BuildJob
    pool:
      name: <your-pool-name>
      demands: python
```

::: moniker-end

The job contains multiple steps:

1. The [UsePythonVersion](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/use-python-version-v0) task selects the version of Python to use. The version is defined in the `pythonVersion` variable.

   ```yml
      - task: UsePythonVersion@0
         inputs:
           versionSpec: '$(pythonVersion)'
           displayName: 'Use Python $(pythonVersion)'
    ```

1. This step uses a script to create a virtual Python environment and install the app's dependencies contained in the `requirements.txt` The `workingDirectory` parameter specifies the location of the app code.

    ```yml
      - script: |
           python -m venv antenv
           source antenv/bin/activate
           python -m pip install --upgrade pip
           pip install setuptools
           pip install  -r ./requirements.txt
         workingDirectory: $(projectRoot)
         displayName: "Install requirements"
   ```

1. The [ArchiveFiles](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/archive-files-v2) task creates the *.zip* archive containing the web app. The `.zip` file is uploaded to the pipeline as the artifact named `drop`. The `.zip` file is used in the deployment stage to deploy the app to the web app.

    ```yml
       - task: ArchiveFiles@2
         displayName: 'Archive files'
         inputs:
           rootFolderOrFile: '$(projectRoot)'
           includeRootFolder: false
           archiveType: zip
           archiveFile: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/$(Build.BuildId).zip
           replaceExistingArchive: true
    
       - upload: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/$(Build.BuildId).zip
         displayName: 'Upload package'
         artifact: drop
    ```

   |**Parameter**|**Description**|
   |---|---|
   |`rootFolderOrFile`|The location of the app code.|
   |`includeRootFolder`|Indicates whether to include the root folder in the *.zip* file. Set this parameter to `false` otherwise, the contents of the *.zip* file are put in a folder named *s* and App Service on Linux container can't find the app code.|
   |`archiveType`|The type of archive to create. Set to `zip`.|
   |`archiveFile`|The location of the *.zip* file to create.|
   |`replaceExistingArchive`|Indicates whether to replace an existing archive if the file already exists. Set to `true`.|
   |`upload`|The location of the *.zip* file to upload.|
   |`artifact`|The name of the artifact to create.|

#### Deployment stage

The deployment stage is run if the build stage completes successfully. The following keywords define this behavior:

```yml
  dependsOn: Build
  condition: succeeded()
```

The deployment stage contains a single deployment job configured with the following keywords:

::: moniker range=">=azure-devops"

```yml
  - deployment: DeploymentJob
    pool:
      vmImage: $(vmImageName)
    environment: $(environmentName)
```

|**Keyword**|**Description**|
|--|---|
|`deployment`|Indicates that the job is a [deployment job](../process/deployment-jobs.md) targeting an [environment](../process/environments.md).|
|`pool`|Specifies deployment agent pool. The default agent pool if the name isn't specified. The `vmImage` keyword identifies the operating system for the agent's virtual machine image|
|`environment`|Specifies the environment to deploy to. The environment is automatically created in your project when the job is run.|

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

```yml
  - deployment: DeploymentJob
    pool:
      name: <your-pool-name>
    environment: $(environmentName)
```

|**Keyword**|**Description**|
|--|---|
|`deployment`|Indicates that the job is a [deployment job](../process/deployment-jobs.md) targeting an [environment](../process/environments.md).|
|`pool` Specifies the agent pool to use for deployment. This pool must contain an agent with the capability to run the python version specified in the pipeline.|
|`environment`|Specifies the environment to deploy to. The environment is automatically created in your project when the job is run.|

::: moniker-end

The `strategy` keyword is used to define the deployment strategy. The `runOnce` keyword specifies that the deployment job runs once. The `deploy` keyword specifies the steps to run in the deployment job.

```yml
  strategy:
    runOnce:
      deploy:
        steps:
```

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

The `steps` in the pipeline are:

1. Use the [UsePythonVersion](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/use-python-version-v0) task to specify the version of Python to use on the agent. The version is defined in the `pythonVersion` variable.

   ```yml
    - task: UsePythonVersion@0
      inputs:
        versionSpec: '$(pythonVersion)'
      displayName: 'Use Python version'
   ```

1. Deploy the web app using the [AzureWebApp@1](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/azure-web-app-v1). This task deploys the pipeline artifact `drop` to your web app.

   ```yml
   - task: AzureWebApp@1
      displayName: 'Deploy Azure Web App : <your-web-app-name>'
      inputs:
         azureSubscription: $(azureServiceConnectionId)
         appName: $(webAppName)
         package: $(Pipeline.Workspace)/drop/$(Build.BuildId).zip
    ```

   |**Parameter**|**Description**|
   |--|---|
   |`azureSubscription`|The Azure Resource Manager service connection ID or name to use.|
   |`appName`|The name of the web app.|
   |`package`|The location of the *.zip* file to deploy.|

    Also, because the *python-vscode-flask-tutorial* repository contains the same startup command in a file named *startup.txt*, you can specify that file by adding the parameter: `startUpCommand: 'startup.txt'`.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

The `steps` in the pipeline are:

1. Use the [UsePythonVersion](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/use-python-version-v0) task to specify the version of Python to use on the agent. The version is defined in the `pythonVersion` variable.

   ```yml
    - task: UsePythonVersion@0
      inputs:
        versionSpec: '$(pythonVersion)'
      displayName: 'Use Python version'
   ```

1. Deploy the web app using the [AzureWebApp@1](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/azure-web-app-v1). This task deploys the pipeline artifact `drop` to your web app.

   ```yml
   - task: AzureWebApp@1
      displayName: 'Deploy Azure Web App : <your-web-app-name>'
      inputs:
         azureSubscription: $(azureServiceConnectionId)

   |`azureSubscription`|The Azure Resource Manager service connection ID or name to use.|
   |`appName`|The name of the web app.|
   |`package`|The location of the *.zip* file to deploy.|

    Also, because the *python-vscode-flask-tutorial* repository contains the same startup command in a file named *startup.txt*, you can specify that file by adding the parameter: `startUpCommand: 'startup.txt'`.

    ```yml
      - task: AzureWebApp@1
         displayName: 'Deploy Azure Web App : $(webAppName)'
         inputs:
           azureSubscription: $(azureServiceConnectionId)
           appName: $(webAppName)
           package: $(Pipeline.Workspace)/drop/$(Build.BuildId).zip
           startUpCommand: 'startup.txt'

## Run the pipeline

You're now ready to try it out! 

1. In the editor, select **Save and run**.
1. In the **Save and run** dialog, add a commit message then select **Save and run**.

    You can watch the pipeline as it runs by selecting the Stages or Jobs in the pipeline run summary. 
    
    :::image type="content" source="../media/python/pipeline-summary-stages-section.png" alt-text="Screenshot of pipeline run summary stages section.":::
    
    There are green check marks next to each stage and job as it completes successfully. If errors occur, they're displayed in the summary or in the job steps. 
    
    :::image type="content" source="../media/python/pipeline-stages.png" alt-text="Screenshot of pipeline stage steps.":::
    
    You can quickly return to the YAML editor by selecting the vertical dots at the upper right of the **Summary** page and selecting **Edit pipeline**:
    
    :::image type="content" source="../media/python/edit-pipeline-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of edit pipeline comment from a build report.":::

1. From the deployment job, select the **Deploy Azure Web App** task to display its output. To visit the deployed site, hold down <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and select the URL after `App Service Application URL`.

   If you're using the sample app, the app should appear as follows:

   :::image type="content" source="../media/python/app-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot of view of the sample app running on App Service.":::

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your app fails because of a missing dependency, then your *requirements.txt* file was not processed during deployment. This behavior happens if you created the web app directly on the portal rather than using the `az webapp up` command as shown in this article.
> 
> The `az webapp up` command specifically sets the build action `SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT` to `true`. If you provisioned the app service through the portal, this action is not automatically set.
> 
> The following steps set the action:
>
> 1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select your App Service, then select **Configuration**.
> 1. Under the **Application Settings** tab, select **New Application Setting**.
> 1. In the popup that appears, set **Name** to `SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT`, set **Value** to `true`, and select **OK**.
> 1. Select **Save** at the top of the **Configuration** page.
> 1. Run the pipeline again. Your dependencies should be installed during deployment.

## Trigger a pipeline run

To trigger a pipeline run, commit a change to the repository. For example, you can add a new feature to the app, or update the app's dependencies.

1. Go to your GitHub repository.
1. Make a change to the code, such as changing the title of the app.
1. Commit the change to your repository.
1. Go to your pipeline and verify a new run is created.
1. When the run completes, verify the new build is deployed to your web app.
    1. In the Azure portal, go to your web app.
    1. Select **Deployment Center** and select the **Logs** tab. 
    1. Verify that the new deployment is listed.


## Considerations for Django

You can use Azure Pipelines to deploy Django apps to Azure App Service on Linux if you're using a separate database. You can't use a SQLite database, because App Service locks the *db.sqlite3* file, preventing both reads and writes. This behavior doesn't affect an external database.

As described in [Configure Python app on App Service - Container startup process](/azure/app-service/containers/how-to-configure-python#container-startup-process), App Service automatically looks for a *wsgi.py* file within your app code, which typically contains the app object. If you want to customize the startup command in any way, use the `startUpCommand` parameter in the `AzureWebApp@1` step of your YAML pipeline file, as described in the previous section.

When using Django, you typically want to migrate the data models using `manage.py migrate` after deploying the app code. You can add `startUpCommand` with a post-deployment script for this purpose. For example, here's the `startUpCommand` property in the AzureWebApp@1 task. 

```yml
  - task: AzureWebApp@1
      displayName: 'Deploy Azure Web App : $(webAppName)'
      inputs:
        azureSubscription: $(azureServiceConnectionId)
        appName: $(webAppName)
        package: $(Pipeline.Workspace)/drop/$(Build.BuildId).zip
        startUpCommand: 'python manage.py migrate'
```

## Run tests on the build agent

As part of your build process, you might want to run tests on your app code. Tests run on the build agent, so you need to install your dependencies into a virtual environment on the build agent. After the tests run, delete the virtual environment before you create the *.zip* file for deployment. The following script elements illustrate this process. Place them before the `ArchiveFiles@2` task in the *azure-pipelines.yml* file. For more information, see [Run cross-platform scripts](../scripts/cross-platform-scripting.md?tabs=yaml). 

```yml
# The | symbol is a continuation character, indicating a multi-line script.
# A single-line script can immediately follow "- script:".
- script: |
    python -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip install setuptools
    pip install -r requirements.txt

  # The displayName shows in the pipeline UI when a build runs
  displayName: 'Install dependencies on build agent'

- script: |
    # Put commands to run tests here
    displayName: 'Run tests'

- script: |
    echo Deleting .env
    deactivate
    rm -rf .env
  displayName: 'Remove .env before zip'
```

You can also use a task like [PublishTestResults@2](../tasks/test/publish-test-results.md?tabs=yaml) to publish the test results to your pipeline. For more information, see [Build Python apps - Run tests](./customize-python.md#run-tests).

## Clean up resources

To avoid incurring charges on the Azure resources created in this tutorial:

* Delete the project that you created. Deleting the project deletes the pipeline and service connection.

* Delete the Azure resource group that contains the App Service and the App Service Plan. In the Azure portal, go to the resource group, select **Delete resource group**, and follow the prompts.

* Delete the storage account that maintains the file system for Cloud Shell. Close the Cloud Shell then go to the resource group that begins with **cloud-shell-storage-**, select **Delete resource group**, and follow the prompts.
