---

You now have a working pipeline that's ready to customize.

<a name="build-environment"></a>
## Set up your build environment

::: moniker range="<=azure-devops-2022"

Azure Pipelines uses [self-hosted agents](../agents/agents.md#install) to build your .NET Core project. You can use the .NET Core SDK and runtime on [Windows](../agents/windows-agent.md), [Linux](../agents/linux-agent.md), [macOS](../agents/osx-agent.md), or [Docker](../agents/docker.md) agents. Make sure that you have the necessary version of the .NET Core SDK and runtime installed on the agents.

To install a specific version of the .NET SDK, add the `UseDotNet@2` task to a YAML pipeline file or the **Use .NET Core** task in the classic editor.

>[!NOTE]
>For agents that run on physical systems, installing SDKs and tools through your pipeline alters the build environment on the agent's host.

The following example YAML snippet installs .NET SDK 8.0.x:

```yaml
steps:
- task: UseDotNet@2
  inputs:
    version: '8.x'
```

To install a newer SDK, set `performMultiLevelLookup` to `true`.

```yaml
steps:
- task: UseDotNet@2
  displayName: 'Install .NET Core SDK'
  inputs:
    version: 8.x
    performMultiLevelLookup: true
    includePreviewVersions: true # Required for preview versions
```

You can select the agent pool and agent for your build job. You can also specify agents based on their capabilities. For example, the following YAML pipeline snippet selects a pool and agent capabilities.

```yml
pool:
  name: myPrivateAgents
  demands:
  - agent.os -equals Darwin
  - anotherCapability -equals somethingElse
```

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">=azure-devops"

You can build your .NET Core projects by using the .NET Core SDK and runtime for Windows, Linux, or macOS. By default, your builds run on [Microsoft-hosted agents](../agents/hosted.md), so you don't need to set up infrastructure.

The Azure Pipelines Microsoft-hosted agents include several preinstalled versions of supported .NET Core SDKs. See [Microsoft-hosted agents](../agents/hosted.md) for a complete list of available images and configuration examples.

The following YAML pipeline snippet sets Ubuntu OS for the agent pool.

```yaml
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest' 
```

Microsoft-hosted agents don't include some older versions of the .NET Core SDK, and don't typically include prerelease versions. If you need these versions of the SDK on Microsoft-hosted agents, you can install them by using the **Use DotNet** ([UseDotNet@2](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/use-dotnet-v2)) task.

For example, the following code installs the .NET 5.0.x SDK:

```yaml
steps:
- task: UseDotNet@2
  inputs:
    version: '5.x'
```

Windows agents already include a .NET Core runtime. To install a newer SDK, set `performMultiLevelLookup` to `true` as in the following snippet:

```yaml
steps:
- task: UseDotNet@2
  displayName: 'Install .NET Core SDK'
  inputs:
    version: 8.x
    performMultiLevelLookup: true
    includePreviewVersions: true # Required for preview versions
```

### Self-hosted agents

Alternatively, you can use [self-hosted agents](../agents/agents.md#self-hosted-agents) to build your .NET Core projects. You can set up [Linux](../agents/linux-agent.md), [macOS](../agents/osx-agent.md), or [Windows](../agents/windows-agent.md) self-hosted agents. 

Self-hosted agents let you:

- Avoid the cost of running the `UseDotNet@2` tool installer.
- Decrease build time if you have a large repository.
- Run incremental builds.
- Use preview or private SDKs that Microsoft doesn't officially support.
- Use SDKs available only on your corporate or on-premises environments.

For more information, see [Self-hosted agents](../agents/agents.md#self-hosted-agents).

## Restore dependencies

NuGet packages are a way for your project to depend on code that you don't build. You can download NuGet packages and project-specific tools by running the `dotnet restore` command, either through the **.NET Core** (`DotNetCoreCLI@2`) task or as a script in your pipeline. The `dotnet restore` command uses the *NuGet.exe* packaged with the .NET Core SDK and can only restore packages specified in the .NET Core project *\*.csproj* files.

You can use the **.NET Core** (`DotNetCoreCLI@2`) task to download and restore NuGet packages from Azure Artifacts, NuGet.org, or another authenticated external or internal NuGet repository. If the NuGet feed is in the same project as your pipeline, you don't need to authenticate. For more information, see [.NET Core task (DotNetCoreCLI@2)](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/dotnet-core-cli-v2).

::: moniker range=">=azure-devops"

When you use Microsoft-hosted agents, you get a new machine every time you run a build, which restores the packages with each run. Restoration can take a significant amount of time. To mitigate this issue, use Azure Artifacts or a [self-hosted agent](#self-hosted-agents) to take advantage of the package cache.

::: moniker-end

The following pipeline uses the `DotNetCoreCLI@2` task to restore an Azure Artifact feed.

```yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'windows-latest'

steps:
- task: UseDotNet@2
  displayName: 'Install .NET Core SDK'
  inputs:
    version: 8.x
    performMultiLevelLookup: true
    includePreviewVersions: true # Required for preview versions

variables:
  buildConfiguration: 'Release'

steps:
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: 'restore'
    feedsToUse: 'select'
    vstsFeed: 'my-vsts-feed' # A series of numbers and letters

- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: 'build'
    arguments: '--configuration $(buildConfiguration)'
  displayName: 'dotnet build $(buildConfiguration)'
```

In .NET Core SDK version 2.0 and newer, packages restore automatically when you run commands such as `dotnet build`. You still need to use the **.NET Core** (`DotNetCoreCLI@2`) task to restore packages if you use an authenticated feed.

Manage the credentials for an authenticated feed by creating a NuGet service connection in **Project Settings** > **Pipelines** > **Service connections**. For more information about NuGet service connections, see [Publish NuGet packages with Azure Pipelines](../artifacts/nuget.md).

### Restore packages from NuGet.org

To restore packages from NuGet.org, update your pipeline as follows.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml-editor)

You can add the restore command to your pipeline by editing the YAML code directly or by using the task assistant.

Add the **.NET Core** (`DotNetCoreCLI@2`) task directly by inserting the following snippet into your *azure-pipelines.yml* file before your build tasks.

```yaml
steps:
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  displayName: Restore
  inputs:
    command: restore
    projects: '**/*.csproj'
    feedsToUse: select
```

To use the task assistant:

1. Go to the position in the YAML file where you want to insert the task.
1. Select **.NET Core** from the task catalog.
1. On the configuration screen, select **restore** from the **Command** dropdown list.
1. In the **Path to project(s) or solution(s)** field, enter the path to your *\*.csproj* files. You can use the wildcard *\*\*/\*.csproj* for all *\*.csproj* files in all subfolders.
1. For **Feeds to add**, ensure that **Feed(s) I select here** and **Use packages from NuGet.org** are selected.
1. Select **Add**.
1. Select **Validate and save**, and then select **Save** to commit the change.

# [Classic](#tab/classic-editor)

You can add a restore task by using the classic editor.

1. On the **Tasks** tab in your pipeline, select **Agent job 1** or other job that runs your build tasks.
1. Select **+** to add a new task to that job.
1. In the task catalog, select **.NET Core** and then select **Add**.
1. In the left pane, select the added **dotnet build** task to open the task editor.
1. Select **restore** from the **Command** dropdown list. The display name changes to **dotnet restore**.
1. In the **Path to project(s) or solution(s)** field, enter the path to your *\*.csproj* files. You can use the wildcard *\*\*/\*.csproj* for all *\*.csproj* files in all subfolders.
1. For **Feeds to add**, ensure that **Feed(s) I select here** and **Use packages from NuGet.org** are selected.
1. In the left pane, drag the task to position it before the **Build** task.
1. At the top of the page, select **Save & queue** > **Save**.

---

### Restore packages from an external feed

To specify an external NuGet repository, put the URL in a *NuGet.config* file in your repository. Make sure any custom feed is specified in your *NuGet.config* file, and that credentials are specified in a NuGet service connection.

To restore packages from an external feed, add the `restore` task as instructed in the previous section, but change the configuration settings as follows:

# [YAML](#tab/yaml-editor)

Add the **.NET Core** (`DotNetCoreCLI@2`) task directly by inserting the following snippet into your *azure-pipelines.yml* file before your build tasks. Replace `<NuGet service connection>` with your service connection name.

```yaml
steps:
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  displayName: Restore
  inputs:
    command: restore
    projects: '**/*.csproj'
    feedsToUse: config
    nugetConfigPath: NuGet.config    # Relative to root of the repository
    externalFeedCredentials: <NuGet service connection>
```

To use the task assistant:

1. Add the **.NET Core** task and select **restore** on the configuration screen as in the preceding procedure.
1. For **Feeds to add**, select **Feeds in my NuGet.config**.
1. Under **Path to NuGet.config**, enter the path to your *NuGet.config* file, relative to the root of your repository. You can select the ellipsis **...** next to the field to browse to and select the location.
1. Under **Credentials for feeds outside this organization/collection**, select credentials to use for external registries in the selected *NuGet.config* file. For feeds in the same organization, you can leave this field blank. The build’s credentials are used automatically.

# [Classic](#tab/classic-editor)

1. Add the **.NET Core** task and select **restore** on the configuration screen.
1. For **Feeds to add**, select **Feeds in my NuGet.config**.
1. Under **Path to NuGet.config**, enter the path to your *NuGet.config* file, relative to the root of your repository. You can select the ellipsis **...** to browse to and select the repository location.
1. Under **Credentials for feeds outside this organization/collection**, select credentials to use for external registries located in the selected *NuGet.config*. For feeds in this organization, you can leave this field blank because the build’s credentials are used automatically.

   You can select **Manage** to go to your project settings and select the connection. You can also select **New** to create a service connection. Be sure to select the checkbox for **Grant access permission to all pipelines**.

---

### Restore packages for .NET Framework projects

If you also have a Microsoft .NET Framework project in your solution or use *package.json* to specify your dependencies, use the **NuGetCommand@2** task to restore those dependencies.

```yaml
- task: NuGetCommand@2
  inputs:
    command: 'restore'
    restoreSolution: '**/*.sln'
    feedsToUse: 'select'
```

>[!NOTE]
>For Ubuntu 24.04 or higher, you must use the **NuGetAuthenticate** task instead of the **NuGetCommand@2** task with the .NET CLI. For more information, see [Support for newer Ubuntu hosted images](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/nuget-command-v2#support-for-newer-ubuntu-hosted-images).

## Build your project

## Add other .NET SDK commands to your pipeline

You can add other .NET SDK commands to your pipeline by using the **.NET Core** (`DotNetCoreCLI@2`) task or as scripts.

### Add a .NET CLI command with the .NET Core task

The [.NET Core (DotNetCoreCLI@2)](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/dotnet-core-cli-v2) task lets you easily add .NET CLI commands to your pipeline. You can add **.NET Core** (`DotNetCoreCLI@2`) tasks by editing your YAML file or by using the classic editor.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml-editor)

To add a .NET Core command using the task assistant in the YAML pipeline editor, do the following steps:

1. Go to the position in the YAML file where you want to insert the task.
1. Select **.NET Core** from the task catalog.
1. Select the command you want to run from the dropdown list in the **Command** field.
1. Configure any options needed.
1. Select **Add**.
1. Select **Save** to commit the change.

### Add a .NET Core CLI command in a script

You can add a .NET Core CLI command as a `script` in your *azure-pipelines.yml* file. For example:

```yml

steps:
# ...
- script: dotnet test <test-project> 
```

# [Classic](#tab/classic-editor)

To add a .NET Core command using the classic editor, do the following steps:

1. On the **Tasks** tab in your pipeline, select **Agent job 1** or other job that runs your build tasks.

1. Configure any options needed.
1. In the left pane, drag the task to position it in the correct task sequence.
1. At the top of the page, select **Save & queue** > **Save**.

---

### Install a tool

To install a .NET Core global tool like [dotnetsay](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnetsay/) in a build running on Windows, add a **.NET Core** task and set the following properties in the configuration:

- **Command**: **custom**
- **Path to projects**: leave empty
- **Custom command**: `tool`
- **Arguments**: `install -g dotnetsay`

To run the tool, add a **Command Line** task and enter `dotnetsay` in the **Script** field.

## Run your tests

When you have test projects in your repository, you can use the **.NET Core** (`DotNetCoreCLI@2`) task to run unit tests by using testing frameworks like MSTest, xUnit, and NUnit. The test project must reference [Microsoft.NET.Test.SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NET.Test.SDK) version 15.8.0 or higher.

Test results automatically publish to the service and are available to you in the build summary. You can use the test results to troubleshoot failed tests and analyze test timing.

To add a test task to your pipeline, add the following snippet to your *azure-pipelines.yml* file:

```yaml
steps:
# ...
# do this after other tasks such as build
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: test
    projects: '**/*Tests/*.csproj'
    arguments: '--configuration $(buildConfiguration)'
```

If you use the task assistant to add the **.NET Core** (`DotNetCoreCLI@2`) task, set the following properties:

- **Command**: **test**
- **Path to projects**: Set to the test projects in your solution
- **Arguments**: `--configuration $(BuildConfiguration)`

Alternatively, you can run the `dotnet test` command with a specific logger and then use the `PublishTestResults@2` task:

```yaml
steps:
# ...
# do this after your tests run
- script: dotnet test <test-project> --logger trx
- task: PublishTestResults@2
  condition: succeededOrFailed()
  inputs:
    testRunner: VSTest
    testResultsFiles: '**/*.trx'
```

## Collect code coverage

When you build on the Windows platform, you can collect code coverage metrics by using the built-in coverage data collector. The test project must reference [Microsoft.NET.Test.SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NET.Test.SDK) version 15.8.0 or higher. 

When you use the **.NET Core** (`DotNetCoreCLI@2`) task to run tests, coverage data automatically publishes to the server. You can download the *\*.coverage* file from the build summary to view in Visual Studio.

To collect code coverage, add the `--collect "Code Coverage"` argument when you add the test task to your pipeline.

```yaml
steps:
# ...
# do this after other tasks such as build
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: test
    projects: '**/*Tests/*.csproj'
    arguments: '--configuration $(buildConfiguration) --collect "Code Coverage"'
```

If you use the task assistant to add the **.NET Core** (`DotNetCoreCLI@2`) task, set the following properties:

- **Command**: **test**
- **Path to projects**: Set to the test projects in your solution
- **Arguments**: `--configuration $(BuildConfiguration) --collect "Code Coverage"`

Ensure that the **Publish test results** option remains selected.

Alternatively, to collect code coverage results by using the `dotnet test` command with a specific logger and then run the [PublishTestResults@2](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/publish-test-results-v2) task, use the following code:

```yaml
steps:
# ...
# do this after your tests run
- script: dotnet test <test-project> --logger trx --collect "Code Coverage"
- task: PublishTestResults@2
  inputs:
    testRunner: VSTest
    testResultsFiles: '**/*.trx'
```

### Collect code coverage metrics with Coverlet

If you build on Linux or macOS, you can use [Coverlet](https://github.com/tonerdo/coverlet) or a similar tool to collect code coverage metrics.

You can publish code coverage results to the server with the [Publish Code Coverage Results (PublishCodeCoverageResults@2)](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/publish-code-coverage-results-v2) task. You must configure the coverage tool to generate results in Cobertura or JaCoCo coverage format.

To run tests and publish code coverage with Coverlet:

1. Add a reference to the `coverlet.collector` NuGet package.
1. Add the following snippet to your *azure-pipelines.yml* file:

  ```yaml
  - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
    displayName: 'dotnet test'
    inputs:
      command: 'test'
      arguments: '--configuration $(buildConfiguration) --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" -- DataCollectionRunSettings.DataCollectors.DataCollector.Configuration.Format=cobertura'
      publishTestResults: true
      projects: '<test project directory>'
    
  - task: PublishCodeCoverageResults@2
    displayName: 'Publish code coverage report'
    inputs:
      codeCoverageTool: 'Cobertura'
      summaryFileLocation: '$(Agent.TempDirectory)/**/coverage.cobertura.xml'
  ```

## Package and deliver your code

To package and deliver your build output, you can:

- Publish your build artifacts to Azure Pipelines.
- Create a NuGet package and publish it to your NuGet feed.
- Publish your NuGet package to Azure Artifacts.
- Create a ZIP archive to deploy to a web app.
- Publish symbols to an Azure Artifacts symbol server or a file share.

You can also [build an image](containers/build-image.md) for your app and [push it to a container registry](containers/push-image.md).

### Publish artifacts to Azure Pipelines

::: moniker range=">=azure-devops"

To publish the output of your .NET build to your pipeline, follow these steps.

1. Run `dotnet publish --output $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)` using the .NET CLI, or add the **.NET Core** (`DotNetCoreCLI@2`) task with the **publish** command.
1. Publish the artifact by using the [Publish Pipeline Artifact (PublishPipelineArtifact@1)](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/publish-pipeline-artifact-v1) task. This task uploads all the files in `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)` as an artifact of your build.

Add the following code to your *azure-pipelines.yml* file:

```yaml
steps:

- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: publish
    publishWebProjects: True
    arguments: '--configuration $(BuildConfiguration) --output $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
    zipAfterPublish: True

- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
  inputs:
    targetPath: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)' 
    artifactName: 'myWebsite'

```

To copy more files to the build directory before publishing, use the [Copy Files (CopyFile@2)](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/copy-files-v2) task.

> [!NOTE]
> The `publishWebProjects` input in the **.NET Core** (`DotNetCoreCLI@2`) task is set to `true` by default, and publishes all web projects in your repository. For more information, see the [azure-pipelines-tasks](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks) GitHub repository.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

To publish the output of your .NET build to your pipeline, do the following tasks: 

1. Run `dotnet publish --output $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)` using the .NET CLI or add the **.NET Core** (`DotNetCoreCLI@2`) task with the **publish** command.
1. Publish the artifact by using the [Publish build artifact (PublishBuildArtifacts@1)](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/publish-pipeline-artifact-v1) task.

The following *azure-pipelines.yml* code also publishes your build artifacts as a ZIP file. The `PublishBuildArtifacts@1` task uploads all the files in `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)` as an artifact of your build.

```yaml
steps:

- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: publish
    publishWebProjects: true
    arguments: '--configuration $(BuildConfiguration) --output $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
    zipAfterPublish: True

- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  inputs:
    PathtoPublish: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
    ArtifactName: 'drop'

```

::: moniker-end

For more information, see [Publish and download build artifacts](../artifacts/build-artifacts.md).

### Publish to a NuGet feed

To create a NuGet package and publish it to your NuGet feed, add the following snippet to your *azure-pipelines.yml* file:

```yaml
steps:
# ...
# do this near the end of your pipeline
- script: dotnet pack /p:PackageVersion=$(version)  # define the version variable elsewhere in your pipeline
- task: NuGetAuthenticate@1
  inputs:
    nuGetServiceConnections: '<NuGet service connection>'
- task: NuGetCommand@2
  inputs:
    command: push
    nuGetFeedType: external
    publishFeedCredentials: '<NuGet service connection>'
    versioningScheme: byEnvVar
    versionEnvVar: version
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `NuGetAuthenticate@1` task doesn't support NuGet API key authentication. If you're using a NuGet API key, use the `NuGetCommand@2` task with the `command` input set to `push` and the `--api-key` argument. For example, `dotnet nuget push --api-key $(NuGetApiKey)`.

For more information about versioning and publishing NuGet packages, see [Publish NuGet packages with Azure Pipelines](../artifacts/nuget.md).

### Publish a NuGet package to Azure Artifacts

You can publish your NuGet packages to your Azure Artifacts feed by using the [NuGetCommand@2](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/nuget-command-v2) task. For more information, see [Publish NuGet packages with Azure Pipelines](../artifacts/nuget.md).

### Publish a ZIP file archive to a web app

To create a ZIP file archive that's ready to publish to a web app, add the following snippet to *azure-pipelines.yml*. Run this task after you build your app, near the end of your pipeline in most cases. For example, run this task before you deploy to an Azure web app on Windows.


```yaml
steps:
# ...
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: publish
    publishWebProjects: True
    arguments: '--configuration $(BuildConfiguration) --output $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
    zipAfterPublish: True
```

To publish this archive to a web app, see [Azure Web Apps deployment](../targets/webapp.md).

### Publish symbols

You can use the `PublishSymbols@2` task to publish symbols to an Azure Artifacts symbol server or a file share. For more information, see [Publish symbols](../artifacts/symbols.md).

For example, to publish symbols to a file share, add the following snippet to your *azure-pipelines.yml* file:

```yaml
- task: PublishSymbols@2
  inputs:
    SymbolsFolder: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)'
    SearchPattern: '**/bin/**/*.pdb'
    IndexSources: true
    PublishSymbols: true
    SymbolServerType: 'FileShare' 
    SymbolsPath: '\\<server>\<shareName>'
```

To use the classic editor, add the **Index sources and publish symbols** task to your pipeline.

## Troubleshooting

If your project builds successfully on your local machine but not in Azure Pipelines, explore the following potential causes and corrective actions.

::: moniker range=">=azure-devops"

- Prerelease versions of the .NET Core SDK aren't installed on Microsoft-hosted agents, and rolling out a new version of the SDK to all Azure Pipelines data centers can take a few weeks. Instead of waiting for a rollout to complete, you can use the [Use .NET Core](#build-environment) task to install the .NET Core SDK version you want on Microsoft-hosted agents.

::: moniker-end

- A new version of the .NET Core SDK or Visual Studio could break the build, for example if it contains a newer version or feature of the NuGet tool. Make sure the .NET Core SDK versions and runtime on your development machine match the pipeline agent.

  You can include a `dotnet --version` command-line script in your pipeline to print the version of the .NET Core SDK. Either use the [.NET Core Tool Installer](#build-environment) to deploy the same version on the agent, or update your projects and development machine to the pipeline version of the .NET Core SDK.

- Your builds might fail intermittently because of connection issues when you restore packages from NuGet.org. NuGet.org might be having issues, or there could be networking problems between the Azure data center and NuGet.org. You can explore whether using Azure Artifacts with [upstream sources](../../artifacts/concepts/upstream-sources.md) to cache the packages improves the reliability of your builds.

  The credentials of the pipeline are automatically used to connect to Azure Artifacts. These credentials are typically derived from the **Project Collection Build Service** account. To learn more about using Azure Artifacts to cache your NuGet packages, see [Connect to Azure Artifact feeds](../../artifacts/nuget/nuget-exe.md).

- You might be using some logic in Visual Studio that isn't encoded in your pipeline. Azure Pipelines runs each command in a task sequentially in a new process. Examine the logs from the pipelines build to see the exact commands that ran in the build. To locate the problem, repeat the same commands in the same order on your development machine.

- If you have a mixed solution that includes some .NET Core projects and some .NET Framework projects, use the **NuGet** task to restore packages specified in the *packages.config* files. Add the **MSBuild** or **Visual Studio Build** task to build the .NET Framework projects.
