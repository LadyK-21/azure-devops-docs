# Run and build numbers

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Azure Pipelines assigns a unique run number (also called a build number) to each pipeline execution. You can customize these numbers to make them more meaningful for your team, using variables, tokens, and naming patterns.

The run number is used to identify a specific execution of a pipeline or build. The build number is synonymous with the run number. 

If you don't specify a build name in YAML pipelines, or you leave the **Name** field blank in Classic pipelines, your run gets a unique integer as its name. You can give runs more useful names that are meaningful to your team. You can use a combination of tokens, variables, and underscore characters in build names.

::: moniker range=">=azure-devops-2020"

You can only customize the run number at the root level of your pipeline using the `name` property. Set the `name` property at the [pipeline](/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema/pipeline) level. The `name` property isn't supported in templates or stages.

The following code sets a custom run number format like `project_def_main_202408281`:

```yaml
name: $(TeamProject)_$(Build.DefinitionName)_$(SourceBranchName)_$(Date:yyyyMMdd).$(Rev:r)

steps:
  - script: echo '$(Build.BuildNumber)'  
```

::: moniker-end

## Run number

The default value for a run number in Azure Pipelines is `$(Date:yyyyMMdd).$(Rev:r)`. `$(Rev:r)` is a special variable format that only works in the build number field. When a build completes, if nothing else in the build number changed, the `Rev` integer value increases by one.

`$(Rev:r)` resets to `1` when any other part of the build number changes. For example, if you configure your build number format as `$(Build.DefinitionName)_$(Date:yyyyMMdd).$(Rev:r)`, the build number resets when the date changes.

If the previous build number was `MyBuild_20230621.1`, the next build number that day is `MyBuild_20230621.2`. The first build number the next day is `MyBuild_20230622.1`.

`$(Rev:r)` also resets to `1` if you change the build number to indicate a version change. For example, if your build format is `1.0.$(Rev:r)` and your last build number was `1.0.3`, if you change the build number to `1.1.$(Rev:r)`, the next build number is `1.1.1`.

## Example

Consider the following data for a build run:

- Project name: Fabrikam
- Pipeline name: CIBuild
- Branch: main
- Build ID/Run ID: 752
- Date: May 6, 2024
- Time: 9:07:03 PM
- One run completed earlier today.

If you specify the following build number format, the second run on May 6, 2024 is named **Fabrikam_CIBuild_main_20240506.2**.

```yaml
$(TeamProject)_$(Build.DefinitionName)_$(SourceBranchName)_$(Date:yyyyMMdd).$(Rev:r)
```

## Tokens

The following table shows how each token resolves, based on the previous example. You can use these tokens only to define run numbers. They don't work anywhere else in a pipeline.

| Token | Example value | Notes |
| ----- | -------------- | ----------- |
| `$(Build.DefinitionName)` | CIBuild | The pipeline name can't contain invalid or whitespace characters.|
| `$(Build.BuildId)` | 752 | `$(Build.BuildId)` is an internal, immutable ID, also called the Run ID, that is unique across the Azure DevOps organization.|
| `$(DayOfMonth)` | 6 ||
| `$(DayOfYear)` | 126 ||
| `$(Hours)` | 21 ||
| `$(Minutes)` | 7 ||
| `$(Month)` | 5 ||
| `$(Rev:r)` | 2 | The third daily run is `3`, and so on. Use `$(Rev:r)` to ensure that every completed build has a unique name. |
| `$(Date:yyyyMMdd)` | 20240506 | You can specify other date formats such as `$(Date:MMddyy)`. |
| `$(Seconds)` | 3 ||
| `$(SourceBranchName)` | main ||
| `$(TeamProject)` | Fabrikam ||
| `$(Year:yy)` | 24 ||
| `$(Year:yyyy)` | 2024 ||

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If you want to show prefix zeros in the run number, you can add more `r` characters to the `Rev` token. For example, specify `$(Rev:rr)` if you want the `Rev` number to begin with `01`, `02`, and so on.
>
>If you use a zero-padded `Rev` as part of a version numbering scheme, some pipeline tasks or popular tools, like NuGet packages, remove the leading zeros. This behavior causes a version number mismatch in the artifacts that are produced.

## Expressions

If you use an expression to set the build number, you can't use some tokens, because their values aren't set at the time expressions are evaluated. These tokens include `$(Build.BuildId)`, `$(Build.BuildURL)`, and `$(Build.BuildNumber)`.

## Variables

You can use user-defined and predefined variables in your build number. For example, if you define `My.Variable`, you can specify the following number format:

```yaml
$(Build.DefinitionName)_$(Build.DefinitionVersion)_$(Build.RequestedFor)_$(Build.BuildId)_$(My.Variable)
```

In the preceding example, the first four variables are predefined. For information on how to define user variables, see [Set variables in pipelines](variables.md#set-variables-in-pipeline).

## FAQ

<!-- BEGINSECTION class="md-qanda" -->

### How large can a run number be, and what characters can I use?

Run numbers can be up to 255 characters. You can't use the characters `"`, `/`, `\`, `:`, `<`, `>`, `'`, `|`, `?`, `@`, or `*`, and you can't end the number with `.`.

### What time zone are the build number time values expressed in?

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

The time zone is UTC.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<azure-devops"

The time zone is the same as the time zone of the operating system of the machine that runs your application tier server.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">=azure-devops-2020"

### How can I set the build number dynamically with conditions?

You can use variables as part of your run number. In the following example, the variable `why` is used as part of the run number, and its value changes depending on the `Build.Reason`.

```yaml
variables:
  - name: why
    ${{ if eq(variables['Build.Reason'], 'PullRequest') }}:
      value: pr
    ${{ elseif eq(variables['Build.Reason'], 'Manual' ) }}:
      value: manual
    ${{ elseif eq(variables['Build.Reason'], 'IndividualCI' ) }}:
      value: indivci
    ${{ else }}:
      value: other

name: $(TeamProject)_$(SourceBranchName)_$(why)_$(Date:yyyyMMdd).$(Rev:r)

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- script: echo '$(Build.BuildNumber)'
```

### How can I reference the run number variable within a script?

You can reference the run number directly as `$(Build.BuildNumber)` in your scripts, or create a custom variable that includes it. For example:

```yaml
# Set MyRunNumber
variables: 
  MyRunNumber: '1.0.0-CI+$(Build.BuildNumber)'

steps:
- script: echo $(MyRunNumber)
- script: echo $(Build.BuildNumber)
```
