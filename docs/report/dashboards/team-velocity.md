# View and configure team velocity

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Velocity metrics provide valuable insights that help teams plan and [forecast](../../boards/sprints/forecast.md) sprints, and evaluate how accurately they estimate and meet planned commitments. These metrics indicate how much work a team can complete during a sprint, based on either **the count of work items completed** or **the sum of estimates** for effort (product backlog items), story points (user stories), or size (requirements). Use velocity to aid in determining team capacity, but don't confuse it with key performance indicators.

## Prerequisites  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/analytics-widgets-prerequisites.md)]

> [!TIP]
> The images in this article might differ from what you see in your web portal. These differences can be due to updates to your web app, options enabled by you or your admin, and the process chosen when creating your project (Agile, Basic, Scrum, or CMMI).

## Understand velocity numbers

**Velocity** represents the amount of work your team completed in past sprints, which helps predict future capacity:

- **When tracking by count**: Velocity shows the number of work items (user stories, bugs, tasks) completed per sprint
- **When tracking by sum**: Velocity shows the total story points, effort hours, or size estimates completed per sprint

For example, if your team completed user stories worth 25 story points in Sprint 1, 30 story points in Sprint 2, and 28 story points in Sprint 3, your average velocity is approximately 28 story points per sprint. This average helps you plan how much work to commit to in future sprints.

## Velocity chart types

You can choose between two Velocity charts: the in-context Velocity chart from the Backlogs page and the Velocity widget for dashboards. Both charts help you quickly understand the workflow state categories described in the following table.

Items in the *Proposed* or *Resolved* states are excluded from the **Completed**, **Completed Late**, and **Incomplete** calculations. For more information, see [How workflow category states are used in Azure Boards](../../boards/work-items/workflow-and-state-categories.md). Your selections are personal and persist across sessions until changed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only Planned columns use historical data for plotting the graph. The rest of the plots (Incomplete, Completed, Completed Late) use current work item data.

|Workflow state|Description |
|---------|---------|
|Planned    |All work items that remain assigned to a sprint by the end of its 1st day, regardless of the state they were in. If a work item was assigned to the sprint by the end of the 1st day and then is removed/re-assigned on or after the 2nd day of the sprint, the work item will continue to be counted as Planned work in the original sprint. If a work item is removed/re-assigned from the sprint before the end of the 1st day of the sprint, it will not count as Planned for that sprint. A work item can be counted as planned in two or more sprints if the work item follows the rule of staying assigned by the end of the 1st day of each of the sprints where it appears|
|Incomplete|Work items currently assigned to the sprint (regardless of when and the state when they were assigned to it) but not yet completed or resolved. This count includes only items in states in the In Progress state category and excludes those in states in the Proposed, Resolved and Completed state categories.   |
|Resolved   |Work items that are in a state that belongs to the Resolved state category. Work items in this category are not plotted in the graph unless the widget is configured to display Resolved work items as Completed. Work items in states belonging to the Resolved state category are excluded in this count unless your widget is configured to treat Resolved items as Completed.|
|Completed|Work items currently assigned to the sprint (regardless of when and the state when they were assigned to it) that are in the state of the Completed state category (i.e. Closed) and have a Completed Date on or before the sprint end date. |
|Completed Late|Work items currently assigned to the sprint (regardless of when and the state when they were assigned to it) that are in the state of the Completed state category and have a Completed Date after the sprint end date.|

> [!NOTE]
> If you configured your widget to display Resolved work items as Completed, moving a Resolved work item to a state in the Completed state category AFTER the sprint end date, it will now be counted as Completed Late and no longer as Completed.

Later in this article, learn how to [open the Velocity in-context report](#velocity-chart) or [configure the Velocity widget](#configure-the-velocity-widget).

#### [In-context Velocity chart](#tab/in-context)

***

You can configure each chart in the following ways: 
- Sum of [Effort, Story Points, size fields](../../boards/queries/query-numeric.md), or other supported numeric fields assigned to backlog items.
- Count of work items on the backlog.
- Number of iterations.  

The widget offers more configuration options. For more information, see [Configure and view Velocity charts](team-velocity.md).

## View the Velocity in-context report   

Velocity reports are available for both product and portfolio backlogs. Each report includes interactive controls, allowing users to customize the view to their specific interests.

1. Sign in to your project (```https://dev.azure.com/{Your_Organization/Your_Project}```).
2. Select **Boards** > **Backlogs** > **Analytics** to open the Velocity report for your product or portfolio backlog. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/cfd/analytics-summary-cfd-velocity.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Backlogs, open Analytics.":::

3. To change to a different backlog, choose from the backlog selector, and then select **View full report** for Velocity.  

4. Use the interactive controls to select the count or sum field and number of iterations. Select **Custom iterations** to specify any number of iterations between 1 and 15. 
   
   If your team doesn't complete a sprint or if you're working on items before a sprint start date, there's no data to analyze and forecast. The following message might display: *Set iteration dates to use this widget*. To resolve this situation, set an iteration date range to include present date or wait for the sprint to start. 

	Hover over a column area to show a summary of planned and completed work items. For example, for the 07_2019 sprint, 131 items are planned.

   For more information, see the [workflow state descriptions](#state-descriptions-table) mentioned earlier in this article.

5. To add the report to a dashboard, select the :::image type="icon" source="media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: actions icon and select **Copy to Dashboard**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/add-charts/add-analytics-chart-abbreviated.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Analytics in-context report, Copy to dashboard option.":::
	
6. Select the dashboard and select **OK**.  

7. To return to the Analytics summary, select the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/back-arrow.png" border="false"::: back arrow.

## Configure the Velocity widget    

You can only configure your Velocity widget for a single team. If you want to view the velocity for several teams, then you must configure a portfolio management team that rolls up from several teams. For more information, see [Add teams](../../organizations/settings/add-teams.md).   

If you haven't yet, [Add the Velocity widget to your dashboard](./add-widget-to-dashboard.md). For Azure DevOps Server 2019, [Enable or install Analytics](analytics-extension.md).

Complete the following steps to configure the Velocity widget.

1. Select the ![Actions icon](../media/icons/actions-icon.png) actions icon and select the **Configure** option to open the configuration dialog.

   :::image type="content" source="media/velocity/configure-dashboard-sequence.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing sequence of highlighted buttons to configure Velocity dashboard."::: 

	Modify the title, select the team, and then select either the backlog level or work item type to track. Select whether you want to track a count of work items or a sum of a numeric field. The most common summed field is that of Effort, Story Points, or Size.     

      :::image type="content" source="media/team-velocity-config-dialog.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Configure dialog, Velocity widget.":::

2. Specify the number of sprints you want to view. The default is 6 and the maximum is 15.    

3. (Optional) Select the check boxes to show additional information for work completed later than planned for each sprint. 

	- **Display planned work for iterations:** Check this box to display the amount of work planned for an iteration at the start of the iteration, which is useful for comparing your planned work to actual deliverables. By default, the count of planned work begins on the start date of the iteration.
	- **Days past start date of iteration when planned work is final**: Specify the number of days past the start date for counting planned work. For example, if the first two days of an iteration are for planning, then you can enter `3`, and planned work gets counted on the third day. For example, if the iteration starts on `01/01/2024`, and three backlog items are assigned to the iteration on `01/01/2024` end-of-day, then those three backlog items are considered as Planned. If your team doesn't complete planning until a few days into the iteration, then you can update the Days past start date of iteration when planned work is final.  
   - **Highlight work completed late:** Check this box to display work items marked complete after the iteration end date, which is considered to be completed late and show as light green. Highlighting work completed late is useful for spotting a trend where work items are marked complete after the iteration is complete.
   - **Days past end date of iteration after which work is late**: Specify the number of days past which you consider a work item late if its status is still new or is in progress. For example, entering three days gives the team 3 days after the end of an iteration to mark work items complete or done, before considered late.

4. Select **Save**. The following image shows Velocity based on Story Points and eight sprints of data.

## Required and recommended tasks for using Velocity charts 
 
For your team to gain the greatest utility from the Velocity charts, follow these required and recommended tasks.  

### Required tasks

- [**Define iteration paths (sprints) and configure team iterations**](../../organizations/settings/set-iteration-paths-sprints.md). Ensure sprints are of the same duration. 
- [**Define and estimate backlog items**](../../boards/backlogs/create-your-backlog.md#estimates). Items created from the team's backlog are automatically assigned to the current sprint and the team's default Area Path.  
- **Update the status of backlog items when work starts and completes**. Only items with a State of *In Progress* or *Done* appear on the Velocity chart or widget. 

### Recommended tasks

- **[Define and size backlog items](../dashboards/team-velocity.md)** for minimized variability.
- **Decide how your team [treats bugs](../../organizations/settings/show-bugs-on-backlog.md)**. If treated like requirements, bugs appear on the backlog and are included in the Velocity chart and forecasting.
- **[Set your team's area path](../../organizations/settings/set-area-paths.md)**. The forecast tool uses these settings to include or exclude items in area paths under the team's default.
- **Avoid creating a hierarchy of backlog items and bugs**. The board, Taskboards, and sprint backlog only show the last node in a hierarchy. Instead, maintain a flat list with parent-child links one level deep. Use **[Features to group requirements or user stories](../../boards/backlogs/organize-backlog.md)**.
- **Update the status of completed backlog items at the end of the sprint**. Move incomplete items back to the product backlog for future sprint planning.
- **Minimize the size variability of backlog items for improved estimation accuracy**. Reducing variability increases the reliability of velocity metrics and forecast results. Estimates are best guesses by the team regarding the effort required to complete an item relative to others on the backlog.

[!INCLUDE [note-delete-area-paths](../../boards/includes/note-delete-area-paths.md)]

## Add other teams

If each team wants their own backlog view, Velocity chart, and forecast tool, you can [add a new team](../../organizations/settings/add-teams.md). Each team has access to its own set of Agile tools, which filter work items to include only the assigned area paths and iteration paths [specific to that team](../../organizations/settings/about-teams-and-settings.md).
