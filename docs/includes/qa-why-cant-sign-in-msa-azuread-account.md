### Q: Why can't I sign in after I select "personal Microsoft account" or "work or school account"?

A: If your sign-in address is shared by both your personal Microsoft account and your work or school account, but the selected identity doesn't have access, you can't sign in. Although both identities use the same sign-in address, they're separate and have different profiles, security settings, and permissions.
Sign out completely from Azure DevOps by completing the following steps. Closing your browser might not sign you out completely. Sign in again and select your other identity:

1. Close all browsers, including browsers that aren't running Azure DevOps.

2. Open a private or incognito browsing session. 

3. Go to this URL: `https://aka.ms/vssignout`.

   A message displays, "Sign out in progress." After you sign out, you're redirected to the Azure DevOps @dev.azure.microsoft.com webpage.

   > [!TIP]
   > If the sign-out page takes longer than a minute, close the browser and try again.

4. Sign in to Azure DevOps again. Select your other identity.
