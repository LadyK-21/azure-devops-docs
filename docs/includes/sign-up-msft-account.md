## Sign up with a personal Microsoft account

1. If you don't have one, [create a Microsoft account](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/).
2. Go to [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/) and select **Get started with Azure**.
3. Select either **Try Azure for free** or **Pay as you go**.
4. Enter your Microsoft account credentials and go through the sign-up process.

   Azure DevOps creates an organization:
   - If you signed up with a newly created Microsoft account, Azure DevOps creates a project named after your account.
   - If you signed up with an existing Microsoft account, [create a project](../organizations/projects/create-project.md) next.

   Sign in to your organization at any time: `https://dev.azure.com/{Your_Organization}`.
