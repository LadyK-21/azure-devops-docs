# Tools and clients that connect to Azure DevOps

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

The Microsoft platform of software development tools is well established. The Visual Basic and Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE) supports teams in their software development, and offers a catalog of plug-ins to extend the product functionality. In particular, the Team Explorer plug-in allows the Visual Studio client to connect to Azure DevOps to support source control, work tracking, build, and test operations. This article describes various tools and clients you can use to connect with Azure DevOps and enhance your development.

## Desktop client developer tools

Developers have access to many tools through the following versions of Visual Studio and plug-ins. To download any version of Visual Studio, go to the [Visual Studio Downloads page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). To understand what features you get with the Visual Studio versions, see [Compare Visual Studio offerings](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/compare/).

For more information, see [Git experience in Visual Studio](/visualstudio/version-control/git-with-visual-studio) and [Side-by-side comparison of Git and Team Explorer](/visualstudio/version-control/git-team-explorer-feature-comparison).  

## Office integration tools

If you want to add and bulk-modify work items with Azure DevOps, you can integrate [Microsoft Office Excel](../boards/backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md). To support the integration, you need to install the [Azure DevOps Office Integration 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#other-family) add-in. 

### Task-specific clients

The following clients support specific tasks, such as managing testing efforts, providing feedback, and modifying work items:

- [**Azure Test Plans**](../organizations/billing/try-additional-features-vs.md): Manage your test efforts, create and run manual tests, and create and track bugs found during test efforts.  
- [**Test & Feedback extension** (previously, the Exploratory Testing extension)](../test/perform-exploratory-tests.md): Access a lightweight plug-in to a web browser. Stakeholders can respond to feedback requests for user stories and features created in Azure DevOps. This extension is free to Stakeholders. 
- [**Microsoft Feedback Client**](/previous-versions/azure/devops/project/feedback/give-feedback): Enable Stakeholders to use this client to record feedback for your application as video, audio, or type-written comments. This client is installed with all versions of Visual Studio, or it can be [installed from the free download](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=48142). All feedback is stored in the work item data store and requires [Stakeholders to have permissions](/previous-versions/azure/devops/project/feedback/give-permissions-feedback).  

## Browser-based web tools

Browser-based web tools are available for connecting with Azure DevOps. You can use collaboration tools that are supported through the web portal or extensions built and maintained by the Azure DevOps Services product team.

### Web portal support

## Marketplace extensions

Visual Studio and Azure DevOps offer various features and functionality, and the ability to extend and share the functionality. Extensions are simple add-ons you can use to customize and extend your Azure DevOps and work tracking experiences. The extensions are written with standard technologies like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. You can also develop your own extensions by using your preferred dev tools:

- Build custom extensions by using the [RESTful API library](#rest-apis).
- Publish your extensions to the Azure DevOps Marketplace.
- Maintain your extensions for private use, or share your extensions with millions of developers who use Visual Studio and Azure DevOps.

For more information, see the [Azure DevOps Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com) and [Overview of extensions](../extend/overview.md).

## REST APIs  
 
The Azure DevOps APIs are based on REST, OAuth, JSON, and service hook. These resources are standard web technologies that are broadly supported in the industry. REST APIs are provided to support building extensions to Azure DevOps. For more information, see [REST API overview](/rest/api/azure/devops).
