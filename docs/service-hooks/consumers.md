# customer intent: As a developer, I want to access reference information about consumers in Azure DevOps service hooks so that I can use service hooks to perform actions on those consumers when events occur in Azure DevOps projects.

# Service hook consumers

[!INCLUDE [Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 | Azure DevOps Server 2020](../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)]

You can use a service hook to perform an action on a consumer service when an event occurs in an Azure DevOps project. For example, a service hook can notify a consumer when a build fails. 

To configure a service hook, you create a subscription that specifies the event, the consumer, and the action. With some consumers, you create a subscription in the consumer service, not in Azure DevOps. This article provides information about the consumer settings you use when you [programmatically create a subscription](create-subscription.md) in Azure DevOps.

You can select from the following consumers when you create a subscription in Azure DevOps:

- [Azure Service Bus](#azure-service-bus)
- [Azure Storage](#azure-storage)
- [Bamboo](#bamboo)
- [Datadog](#datadog)
- [Grafana](#grafana)
- [Jenkins](#jenkins)
- [Slack](#slack)
- [Trello](#trello)
- [Webhooks](#webhooks)
- [Zendesk](#zendesk)

For information about these consumers and others you can integrate with service hooks, see [Available services](overview.md#available-services).
