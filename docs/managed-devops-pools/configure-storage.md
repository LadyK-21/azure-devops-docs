# Configure storage

If you want more disk space for your agents, Managed DevOps Pools supports attaching an empty data disk to the agents in your Managed DevOps Pool. Attaching a data disk allows you to get more storage space without incurring the potentially greater cost of moving your VM size to a more expensive size that has more built-in storage.

## Attach an empty data disk

#### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal/)

Configure storage settings when creating your pool on the **Storage** tab. The default setting is no empty data disk.

If you are configuring additional storage for an existing pool, go to the pool in the Azure portal as described in the following steps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Search for **Managed DevOps Pools** and select it from the available options.
1. Choose your Managed DevOps Pool from the list.
1. Go to **Settings** > **Storage** to configure the empty data disk settings for your pool.

:::image type="content" source="media/configure-storage/empty-data-disk-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot of empty data disk menu.":::

Configure the following properties for your disk, and choose **Apply** (or **Next** if you are creating a pool) to save your changes. You can add a single empty data disk configuration for your Managed DevOps Pool, and all agent instances will have an empty data disk attached matching the configuration you specify.

Choose **Delete** to delete the data disk configuration for an existing pool.

#### [ARM template](#tab/arm/)

Additional disk storage is configured in an ARM template in the property `dataDisks` section under `storageProfile`. In the following example, a 10 GB `Standard_LRS` disk is configured with  the drive letter `Q` and no caching.

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "resources": [
        {
            "name": "fabrikam-managed-pool",
            "type": "microsoft.devopsinfrastructure/pools",
            "apiVersion": "2025-01-21",
            "location": "eastus",
            "properties": {
                ...
                "fabricProfile": {
                  ...
                  "storageProfile": {
                      "osDiskStorageAccountType": "Standard",
                      "dataDisks": [
                          {
                              "diskSizeGiB": 10,
                              "caching": "None",
                              "storageType": "Standard_LRS",
                              "driveLetter": "Q"
                          }
                      ]
                  }
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

To delete the data disk configuration for an existing pool, specify an empty list for `dataDisks`: `"dataDisks": []`.

#### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli/)

Additional disk storage is configured using the `dataDisks` property in the `storageProfile` section in the `fabric-profile` parameter.

```azurecli
az mdp pool create \
   --fabric-profile fabric-profile.json
   # other parameters omitted for space
```

In the following example, a 10 GB Standard_LRS disk is configured with  the drive letter `Q` and no caching.

The following example shows the `storageProfile` section of the **fabric-profile.json** file.

```json
{
  "vmss": {
    "sku": {...},
    "images": [...],
    "osProfile": {...},
    "storageProfile": {
      "osDiskStorageAccountType": "Standard",
      "dataDisks": [
        {
          "diskSizeGiB": 10,
          "caching": "None",
          "storageType": "Standard_LRS",
          "driveLetter": "Q"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

To delete the data disk configuration for an existing pool, specify an empty list for `dataDisks`: `"dataDisks": []`.

#### [Bicep](#tab/bicep/)

Additional disk storage is configured in a Bicep template in the property `dataDisks` section under `storageProfile`. In the following example, a 10 GB `Standard_LRS` disk is configured with  the drive letter `Q` and no caching.

```bicep
resource managedDevOpsPools 'Microsoft.DevOpsInfrastructure/pools@2025-01-21' = {
  name: 'fabrikam-managed-pool'
  location: 'eastus'
  properties: {
    ...
    fabricProfile: {
      ...
      storageProfile: {
        osDiskStorageAccountType: 'Standard'
        dataDisks: [
          {
            diskSizeGiB: 10
            caching: 'None'
            storageAccountType:'Standard_LRS'
            driveLetter: 'Q'
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To delete the data disk configuration for an existing pool, specify an empty list for `dataDisks`: `dataDisks: []`.

Configure the following properties for your attached data disk.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Size (GiB) | Specify the size of your data disk. The maximum size depends on the storage type. For more information, see [Disk type comparison](/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types#disk-type-comparison) .|
| Caching Type | Specify the caching type for your disk. Choose from: **Default**, **None**, **ReadOnly**, **ReadWrite**. The default for data disks that support caching is **ReadOnly**. For more information, see [Virtual machine and disk performance](/azure/virtual-machines/disks-performance). |
| Storage Type | Choose from the following storage types: **Standard_LRS** (default), **Premium_LRS**, **StandardSSD_LRS**, **Premium_ZRS**, **StandardSSD_ZRS**. For more information about these types, see [SKU Types](/rest/api/storagerp/srp_sku_types) and [Azure managed disk types](/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types). |
| Drive Letter | If you have any Windows agent images in your pool, choose a drive letter for your disk. If you don't specify a drive letter, **F** is used for VM sizes with a temporary disk; otherwise **E** is used. The drive letter must be a single letter except **A**, **C**, **D**, or **E**. If you are using a VM size without a temporary disk and want **E** as your drive letter, leave **Drive Letter** empty to get the default value of **E**. If you're using an ARM template or Azure CLI script to configure your storage, omit the drive letter parameter if you don't want a drive letter. |

## Use the data disk for your agent working directory

To configure your agents to use a working directory on the data disk, specify a folder from the data disk in a `WorkFolder` demand.

#### [Windows](#tab/windows/)

In the following example, the agent working directory on a Windows agent is configured to use a folder on an attached data disk that is assigned the drive letter **F**.

```yml
pool:
  name: fabrikam-managed-pool # Name of Managed DevOps Pool
  demands:
  - WorkFolder -equals f:\custom-work-folder # Windows agent example
```

#### [Linux](#tab/linux/)

For Linux agents, the data disk is mounted as **/mnt/storage/sdc**. The following example configures the agent working directory to be a folder named **custom-work-folder** on the data disk.

```yml
pool:
  name: fabrikam-managed-pool # Name of Managed DevOps Pool
  demands:
  - WorkFolder -equals /mnt/storage/sdc/custom-work-folder
```
