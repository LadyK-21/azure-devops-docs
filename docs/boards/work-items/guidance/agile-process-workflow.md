# Agile workflow in Azure Boards  

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

When you apply the Agile process in Azure Boards, you can use several work item types (WITs) help your team plan and track project progress. The available WITs include epics, features, user stories, tasks, issues, and bugs. After the WITs are defined, you can use the board to track progress by updating the status for specific items.

:::image type="content" source="../../../organizations/settings/work/media/scrum-to-agile/agile-process-plan-wits.png" border="false" alt-text="Conceptual image of the Agile process in Azure Boards where you can use work item types to plan and track work.":::

To gain insight into a portfolio of features, scenarios, or user experiences, product owners and program managers map **user stories** to **features**. When a team works in sprints, they define **tasks** that automatically link to user stories. If you're getting started with the Agile process, review how to [plan and track work with Agile](agile-process.md#start-using).

From the web portal or Microsoft Test Manager, testers can create and run test cases against **bugs and issues**, which are used to track code defects and blocking issues.  

## Define user stories

Product owners typically define and stack rank user stories, which describe the work involved for developing applications, requirements, and elements. The team then estimates the effort and work to deliver the highest priority items.

Create user stories from the quick add panel on the [Product Backlog page](../../backlogs/create-your-backlog.md). You can also drag-and-drop items in the page and then reorder the items or [map the items to features](../../backlogs/organize-backlog.md). 
 
:::image type="content" source="../media/about-work-items/work-item-form-user-story.png" alt-text="Screenshot of User Story work item form." lightbox="../media/about-work-items/work-item-form-user-story-large.png":::

You can open each user story to provide more details and estimate the story points. Define **Story Points** so your team can use the forecast feature and velocity charts to estimate future sprints or work efforts. By prioritizing the user stories on the backlog page (which is captured in the **Stack Rank** field), product owners can indicate the items to assign with higher priority.

Use the guidance in the following table and the [common fields used across work item types](#definitions-in-common) when you complete the form.  

:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   **Field**
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   **Usage**
   :::column-end:::

---
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   [Description](../../queries/titles-ids-descriptions.md)  
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   For user stories, provide enough detail for estimating how much work is required to implement the story. Focus on who the feature is for, what users want to accomplish, and why. Don't describe how the feature should be developed. Do provide sufficient details so your team can write tasks and test cases to implement the item.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   [Acceptance Criteria](../../queries/titles-ids-descriptions.md) 
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   Provide the criteria to be met before the bug or user story can be closed. Before work begins, describe the customer acceptance criteria as clearly as possible. Conversations between the team and customers to define the acceptance criteria help ensure your team understands your customers' expectations. You can use the acceptance criteria as the basis for acceptance tests to more effectively evaluate whether an item is satisfactorily completed.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   [Value Area](../../queries/planning-ranking-priorities.md)
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   The area of customer value addressed by the epic, feature, requirement, or backlog item. Values include:  
   - **Architectural**: Technical services to implement business features that deliver solutions.
   - **Business**: (Default) Services that fulfill customer or stakeholder needs and directly deliver customer value to support the business.

:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   [Story Points](../../queries/query-numeric.md)
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   Estimate the amount of work required to complete a user story by using any numeric unit of measurement your team prefers. Agile [velocity charts](../../../report/dashboards/team-velocity.md) and [forecast](../../sprints/forecast.md) tools reference the values in this field.

## Track progress

As work progresses, you change the **State** field to update the status. Optionally, you can specify a reason. The **State** and **Reason** fields appear on the work item form in the header area:

:::image type="content" source="media/agile-bug-form-state-reason.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Bug work item form, header area, showing the State and Reason fields.":::

### Agile workflow states 

When you update the workflow, teams can view which items are new, in progress, or completed. Most WITs support transitions forward and backward from each workflow state. The following diagrams show the main progression and regression states for user story, bug, and task WITs. 

:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::

   :::image type="content" source="media/ALM_PT_Agile_WF_UserStory.png" alt-text="Conceptual image of User Story workflow states, Agile process.":::

   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="1":::
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/agile-bug-workflow.png" alt-text="Conceptual image of Bug workflow states, Agile process.":::

   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="1":::

   :::image type="content" source="media/ALM_PT_Agile_WF_Task.png" alt-text="Conceptual image of Task workflow states, Agile process.":::
   
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

Here's the typical workflow progression for a user story:

1. The product owner creates a user story in the **New** state with the default reason, **New user story**.  
1. The team updates the story status to **Active** when they decide to complete the work during the sprint.  
1. The story moves to the **Resolved** state when the team completes all associated tasks and unit tests for the story pass.  
1. The story moves to the **Closed** state when the product owner agrees the story is implemented according to the Acceptance Criteria and acceptance tests pass.

### Update status with board or Taskboards

Teams can use the [board](../../boards/kanban-overview.md) to update the status of requirements, and the [Taskboard](../../sprints/task-board.md) to update the status of tasks. Dragging items to a new state column updates both the **State** and **Reason** fields.

:::image type="content" source="../../boards/media/alm-cc-move-card.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Track progress on the board.":::

You can customize the board to support more [swimlanes](../../boards/expedite-work.md) or [columns](../../boards/add-columns.md). For more information, see [Customize your work tracking experience](#customize-work-item-types).

## Map user stories to features

When you manage a suite of products or user experiences, you might want to view the scope and progress of work across the product portfolio. You can view the scope and progress of work by [defining features](../../backlogs/define-features-epics.md) and [mapping user stories to features](../../backlogs/organize-backlog.md).

Using portfolio backlogs, you can [drill down from one backlog to another](../../plans/portfolio-management.md) to view the level of detail you want. Also, use portfolio backlogs to view a rollup of work in progress across several teams when you [set up a hierarchy of teams](../../../organizations/settings/add-teams.md).

## Define tasks 

When your team manages their work in sprints, they can use the [sprint backlog page](../../sprints/assign-work-sprint.md) to break down the planned work into distinct tasks.  

:::image type="content" source="media/IC697761.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Sprint backlog, add task.":::

Name the task and estimate the work it takes in the **Effort** section:

:::image type="content" source="media/agile-task-form.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Agile task work item form." lightbox="media/agile-task-form.png":::

When you use the Agile process, teams forecast work and define tasks at the start of each sprint. Each team member then performs a subset of the identified tasks. Tasks can include development, testing, and other kinds of work. For example, a developer defines tasks to implement user stories, and a tester defines tasks to write and run test cases.

When teams estimate work according to the number of hours or days, they define tasks and the **Remaining Work** and **Activity** (optional) fields.

:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   **Field**
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   **Usage**
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
---
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   [Original Estimate](../../queries/query-numeric.md)
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   The amount of estimated work required to complete a task. Typically, the field value doesn't change after you enter the initial value. You can specify work in number of hours or days. There are no inherent time units associated with this field.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   [Remaining Work](../../queries/query-numeric.md)
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   The amount of work remaining to complete a task. As work progresses, update this field. If you divide a task into subtasks, specify hours for the subtasks only. You can specify work in any unit of measurement your team chooses. This field is used to calculate the following charts and SQL Server reports:
   - [Capacity chart](../../sprints/set-capacity.md)
   - [Sprint Burndown chart](../../../report/dashboards/configure-sprint-burndown.md)
   - [SQL Server report: Burndown and Burn Rate](/previous-versions/azure/devops/report/sql-reports/burndown-and-burn-rate-report)
   - [SQL Server report: Remaining Work](/previous-versions/azure/devops/report/sql-reports/remaining-work-report)
   - [SQL Server report: Status on All Iterations](/previous-versions/azure/devops/report/sql-reports/status-on-all-iterations-report)
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   [Completed Work](../../queries/query-numeric.md) 
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   The amount of work spent implementing a task.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   [Activity](../../queries/query-numeric.md) 
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   Select the type of activity this task represents when your team estimates sprint capacity by activity.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   [Integrated in Build](../../queries/build-test-integration.md)
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   The product build number that incorporates the code or fixes a bug.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

## Track test progress 

Track testing progress with [user stories](#test-user-stories) and [bugs for code defects](#track-code-defects). For information about tracking other types of issues, see [Track other issues](#track-other-issues).

### Test user stories

From the web portal or Test Manager, you can [create test cases that automatically link to a user story or bug](../../../test/create-test-cases.md). Or, you can link a user story to a test case from the :::image type="icon" source="../../backlogs/media/icon-links-tab-wi.png" border="false"::: **Links** tab. 

:::image type="content" source="media/test-plan-new-item.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Test plan web portal.":::

The test case contains multiple fields, many of which are automated and integrated with Test Manager and the build process. For a description of each field, see [Query based on build and test integration fields](../../queries/build-test-integration.md).

:::image type="content" source="media/agile-test-case-form.png" alt-text="Screenshot of test case form." lightbox="media/agile-test-case-form.png" :::

The :::image type="icon" source="../../backlogs/media/icon-links-tab-wi.png" border="false"::: **Links** tab captures the links to user stories and bugs in a test case. By linking user stories and bugs to test cases, the team can track the progress made during testing for each item. By defining these links, you support information that appears in the SQL Server [Stories Overview](/previous-versions/azure/devops/report/sql-reports/stories-overview-report-agile) report.

### Track code defects

You can [create bugs from the web portal, Visual Studio, or when testing with Test Manager](../../backlogs/manage-bugs.md) to track testing for code defects. 

[!INCLUDE [Definitions for common work tracking fields](../../includes/common-work-item-fields.md)]

## Track other issues 

Issues are used to track events that might block progress or prevent shipping a user story. Bugs, on the other hand, are used to track code defects. You can add an issue with the [New work item widget](../../../report/dashboards/widget-catalog.md#new-work-item-widget) on a [team dashboard](../../../report/dashboards/dashboards.md), or from the **New** menu on the **Queries** page. 

:::image type="content" source="../../../user-guide/media/features/alm-feature-new-work-item-widget.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Add work item from a New Work Item widget."::: 

Work items you add from the widget are automatically scoped to your team's default area and iteration paths. To change the team context, see [Switch team context](../../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md).  
 
### Track business value

You can use the **Priority** field to differentiate the value of various stories. Or, you can add a custom field to the User Story WIT that tracks the relative value of stories. For more information, see [Customize a field for a process](../../../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-field.md).

### Backlog list order

The [Stack Rank](../../queries/planning-ranking-priorities.md) field is used to track the relative ranking of user stories. By default, this field doesn't appear on the work item form. The sequence of items on the backlog page is determined according to where you [add the items or move the items on the page](../../backlogs/create-your-backlog.md#move-items-priority-order). As you drag items, a background process updates the **Stack Rank** field.
