# About workflow states in backlogs and boards

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Workflows are essential for managing work items, consisting of states, transitions, and reasons. Each workflow is defined for a specific work item type. Transitions allow movement between states, both forward and backward. When you add a custom state, the system automatically includes transitions to all other inherited states, except for the Removed state.

Each state is categorized to support Agile tool backlogs and board views, ensuring a streamlined and organized workflow process.

## Workflow states

Workflow states define how a work item progresses from creation to closure. For the User Story (Agile process), the main states are New, Active, Resolved, and Closed. The Removed state is used to remove a work item from the backlog; for more information, see [Move, change, or delete work items](../backlogs/remove-delete-work-items.md#remove).

The natural progressions and regressions for work item types—user story (Agile), issue (Basic), product backlog item (Scrum), and requirement (CMMI)—are as shown.

## Category states

Category states determine how Agile planning tools and dashboard widgets treat each workflow state. Work item types use state categories to track progress. These states apply across all projects using the same process and affect how work items appear on backlogs and boards. The state categories used by backlogs, boards, and widgets are *Proposed*, *In Progress*, *Resolved*, and *Complete*.

The following table shows how the default, inherited states map to the category states for the four system processes, including Test Plan work item types. The workflow states for Test Case, Test Design, and Test Suite are the same across all four system processes.

### Work item types and their boards

Understand where each work item type appears so you can manage your work effectively.

|Work item type category |Work items appear here |
|---------|---------|
|Requirement    |  Only on the product board.       | 
|Feature   | Only on the Feature portfolio board.        |         
|Epic     | Only on the Epic portfolio board.        | 
|Custom|    Only on a custom portfolio board. |        

> [!TIP]   
> We recommend that you map each workflow state to a column. If it’s not mapped, it doesn’t appear on the board.

[!INCLUDE [activated-resolved-by-fields](../includes/activated-resolved-by-fields.md)]

## When to add a State versus a column

Use both States and columns to track work status. Workflow states are shared across a project, while columns are shared within a team. Only project collection admins can add custom states, while team admins can add columns.

Add custom states to align all teams with the organization's business workflow. Customizing the process automatically customizes the projects and work item types that reference it.

Custom states help avoid confusion from different teams creating queries based on columns. Since teams can customize board columns and swimlanes, work item values might differ across boards. Maintain single ownership of work items by team area path or formalize columns by adding custom states shared across teams.

## Auto completion of work items with pull requests 

When you link a work item to a pull request (PR), you can automatically complete those work items when you complete the PR. For more information, see [Auto complete work items with pull requests](auto-complete-work-items-pull-requests.md).

## Automate work item state transitions

You can automatically update the state of a work item according to the state of its child tasks. For more information, see [Automate work item state transitions](automate-work-item-state-transitions.md).
