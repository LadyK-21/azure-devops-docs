# Install the Azure Boards app for GitHub  

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2020](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)]

In this quickstart, you install the Azure Boards app for GitHub to connect Azure Boards to your GitHub repositories. When you connect Azure Boards projects with GitHub.com repositories, you support linking between GitHub commits and pull requests to work items. You can use GitHub for software development while using Azure Boards to plan and track your work. After you install the Azure Boards app for GitHub on your GitHub account or organization, choose which GitHub repositories you want to connect to from your project.

For an overview of the integration that the Azure Boards app for GitHub supports, see [Azure Boards-GitHub integration](index.md).

## Prerequisites 

| Category | Requirements |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Permissions** | - Member of the [**Project Collection Administrators** group](../../organizations/security/change-organization-collection-level-permissions.md). If you created the project, you have permissions.<br> - **Administrator** or **owner** of the GitHub organization for installing the Azure Boards app. <br> - **Read** permissions for the GitHub repository. |
| **Project membership**|  [Project member](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md). |

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If your repository is already connected by using another authentication type such as OAuth, you must remove that repository from your existing connection before you reconnect it by using the GitHub App. Follow the steps provided in [Add or remove GitHub repositories](#add-remove-repos) later in this article before you configure the GitHub App.
>
> You can connect an Azure DevOps organization to multiple GitHub repositories if you're an administrator for those repositories. You shouldn't connect a GitHub repository to more than one Azure DevOps organization.

## Install and configure the Azure Boards app 

Your installation sequence might vary due to your account configuration. If necessary, follow on screen prompts between the following steps.

1. Go to the Azure Boards app in the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/azure-boards). 

1. Under **Plans and pricing**, under **Free**, select **Install**.

1. In **Install & Authorize Azure Boards**, choose the repositories that you want to connect to Azure Boards, then select **Install & Authorize**.

   This example uses **All repositories**:

<a id="install"></a>

## Use the connection 

At this point, your Azure Boards-GitHub integration is complete. You can skip the next steps or go through them to understand the features supported with the connection.  

1. On your board, select **New work item** to enter a new work item named "Add badge to README"&mdash;Issue (Basic), User Story (Agile), or Product Backlog Item (Scrum)&mdash;depending on the process model used by your Azure Boards project. 

	A work item titled *Add badge to README* appears on your board. 

1. Open your work item, go to the **Development** section, and select **Add link**.
1. From **Link type**, select **GitHub Pull Request**.
1. Select the repository and enter the pull request ID and an optional comment.
1. Select **Add link**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot/add-link-to-pull-request-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Add link action in user story, showing repository selection and empty boxes for input of pull request ID and optional comment."::: 

	The following actions occur in the background, automatically:

	- Adds a badge to the README file of the first repository in the list of connected GitHub repositories.  
	- Creates a GitHub commit for the update made by adding the badge to the README file.
	- Creates a GitHub pull request to merge the changes made to the README file.  
	- Links the GitHub commit and pull request to the work item created in step 1.  

1. Select the first pull request link from your work item.

   :::image type="content" source="media/github-app/issue-add-badge.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the issue form for pull request opened in GitHub.":::

   The GitHub pull request opens in a new browser tab.

1. Select **Merge pull request**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/github-app/git-hub-pr-for-badge-b.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the example pull request in GitHub."::: 

1. Go to your repository README file and view the badge that was added. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/github-app/readme-file-with-badge.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the GitHub repo with badge added.":::

## Update Azure Boards-GitHub connections
 
If you change the repositories that the Azure Boards app for GitHub supports, you might get redirected to Azure Boards GitHub connections. A good practice is to remove the repositories in Azure Boards that can no longer connect to GitHub. For more information, see [Add or remove GitHub repositories](#add-remove-repos).

If you uninstall the Azure Boards app for GitHub, the following message displays in Azure Boards, **Project settings** > **GitHub** connections. Choose **Remove connection** to remove all previously made GitHub connections. For more information, see [Add or remove GitHub repositories](#add-remove-repos). 

:::image type="content" source="media/change-repo-access/boards-remove-connection.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows uninstalled Azure Boards GitHub app.":::
