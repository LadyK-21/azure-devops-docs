# What is the Azure Boards-GitHub integration?

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2020](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)]

Stay aligned and coordinated with Azure Boards and link your code activity and issues from GitHub. This article provides an overview of the integration between Azure Boards and GitHub.

> [!IMPORTANT]   
> If you want to configure and manage your connections to GitHub.com, use the [Azure Boards app for GitHub](install-github-app.md). The app provides a more streamlined configuration experience and has the advantage of authenticating and operating as the app rather than an individual. After you connect, you can manage the repositories either from Azure Boards or GitHub.com.

## Integration between Azure Boards and GitHub

Azure Boards and Azure DevOps support integration with GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Server repositories. You can start from either Azure Boards or GitHub to integrate and connect to GitHub repositories to an Azure Boards project. 

Azure DevOps Services supports up to 500 GitHub repository connections per connection. Azure DevOps 2022 supports up to 500 repositories, and earlier versions support up to 100 repositories.

- [Install and configure the Azure Boards app for GitHub](install-github-app.md)

- [Connect an Azure Boards project to one or more GitHub repositories](connect-to-github.md)
