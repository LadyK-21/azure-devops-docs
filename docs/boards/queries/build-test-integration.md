# Create a query based on build and test integration fields

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Work item fields that support build and test integration offer powerful functionalities to enhance your development workflow. These integrations enable the following key actions:

- **Associate bugs with builds:** Link bugs directly to the specific builds where they were discovered or resolved, ensuring precise tracking and accountability.
- **Query bugs by build:** Retrieve and analyze bugs associated with particular builds to identify trends and areas needing improvement.
- **Mark test cases as Manual or Automated:** Categorize test cases accordingly and store relevant information to support automated testing processes.
- **Define action and validation steps for test cases and shared steps:** Specify the actions to perform, validation criteria, and the data required to execute tests effectively.

This article provides guidance on how to use build and test integrations to improve your project's quality and efficiency.

## Prerequisites

- **Project-level permissions**:
  - **Contributors**: Can create and edit queries.
  - **Readers**: Can view queries but can't create or edit them.
  - **Project Administrators**: Have full control over all project settings, including queries.
- **Specific permissions for Test Artifacts**:
- **Manage Test Plans**: Allows creating, editing, and deleting test plans.
- **Manage Test Suites**: Allows creating, editing, and deleting test suites.
- **Edit Work Items in this Node**: Required to add or edit test-specific work items like test cases and test suites.

## Supported operators and macros 

Most build and test integration fields have a data type of String, PlainText, or HTML. Query clauses that specify a text or rich-text field can use the operators and macros listed in the following table.

### Fields that integrate with Team Foundation Build

Team Foundation Build is the on-premises build system you can use with Azure DevOps Server. You can configure your build process by using Team Foundation Build, and Team Foundation Build can generate work items when a build fails. It can also add build information to work items that were resolved in a particular build. Team Foundation Build requires that the following two fields get added to the work item type definition: **Found In** and **Integration Build**.

**Found In** and **Integrated in Build** fields are defined for Bugs in the default processes. These fields associate bugs with the builds where they were found or fixed. 

You can use the following code snippet to add these fields to a WIT definition.

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
> ```XML
> <FIELD name="Found In" refname="Microsoft.VSTS.Build.FoundIn" type="String" reportable="dimension">
>     <HELPTEXT>Product build number (revision) in which this item was found</HELPTEXT>
>         <SUGGESTEDVALUES>
>           <LISTITEM value="&lt;None&gt;" />
>         </SUGGESTEDVALUES>
> </FIELD>
> <FIELD name="Integration Build" refname="Microsoft.VSTS.Build.IntegrationBuild" type="String" reportable="dimension">
>     <HELPTEXT>Product build number this bug was fixed in</HELPTEXT>
>         <SUGGESTEDVALUES>
>           <LISTITEM value="&lt;None&gt;" />
>         </SUGGESTEDVALUES>
> </FIELD>
> ```


When the **Found In** field is present in a WIT definition, Team Foundation Build creates a work item when a build fails, and sets the **Found In** field to the build number of the build that failed. If the **Found In** field is missing, Team Foundation Build doesn't create a work item for the failed build, and everything else works as expected.

When the **Integration Build** field is present in the WIT definition, Team Foundation Build identifies work items that were resolved with each build and then updates those work items to set the build number in which they were resolved in the **Integration Build** field. If the **Integration Build** field is missing, Team Foundation Build doesn't store the build number in the work items, and everything else works as expected.


<a id="global-list"></a> 

### Builds and global list autopopulation

The first time you queue a build for a project using Team Foundation Build, it automatically adds a global list labeled <strong>Build - <em>ProjectName</em></strong>. Each time a build is run, a <strong>LISTITEM</strong> is added to this global list with the name of the build.

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

By adding a **GLOBALLIST** element to the **FIELD** definition, you can provide a drop-down menu of builds that users can choose from. For example:

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
> ```XML
> <FIELD name="Found In" refname="Microsoft.VSTS.Build.FoundIn" type="String" reportable="dimension">
>     <HELPTEXT>Product build number (revision) in which this item was found</HELPTEXT>
>         <SUGGESTEDVALUES>
>           <LISTITEM value="&lt;None&gt;" />
>         </SUGGESTEDVALUES>
>         <SUGGESTEDVALUES expanditems="true" filteritems="excludegroups">
>           <GLOBALLIST name="Builds - TeamProjectName" />
>         </SUGGESTEDVALUES>
> </FIELD>
> ```

::: moniker-end


<a id="tf-build"></a> 

### Fields that Integrate with Test Plans

With Test Plans, you can automate the creation of a bug or other type of work item when a test fails. For more information, see <a href="../../test/add-to-bugs-exploratory-testing.md" data-raw-source="[Add findings to existing bugs with exploratory testing](../../test/add-to-bugs-exploratory-testing.md)">Add findings to existing bugs with exploratory testing</a>.

When you create a work item in this manner, information about the system and the steps to reproduce the bug gets captured in the **System Info** and **Repro Steps** fields.

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"
You can add these fields to work item types that you create for tracking defects using the following code snippet.

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
> ```XML
> <FIELD name="System Info" refname="Microsoft.VSTS.TCM.SystemInfo" type="HTML" />
> <FIELD name="Repro Steps" refname="Microsoft.VSTS.TCM.ReproSteps" type="HTML" />
> ```

::: moniker-end

### Fields that integrate with Team Foundation Version Control

**Associating and resolving work items with TFVC**

Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) offers a feature that allows you to associate or resolve work items directly during the code check-in process. When you work on a specific work item and make corresponding code changes, you can link that work item from within the source-control check-in window upon completing your changes.

**How TFVC resolves work items**

The ability of TFVC to resolve a work item depends on the presence of a specific action within the work item. Here's how the process works:

1. **Action verification:** The source control system queries the work item tracking system to determine if the work item supports the required action.
2. **State transition:** If the action is supported, TFVC retrieves the source and destination states associated with the transition.
3. **Work item update:** Upon checking in the code, TFVC transitions the work item's state according to the predefined transition.

This integration ensures that work items accurately reflect the status of associated code changes, enhancing traceability and accountability within your development workflow.
> [!NOTE]
> When you use the **Checkin** action, you must set appropriate *from* and *to* states to reflect the state transition that you want.

For more information, see [Automate field assignments based on State, Transition, or Reason](/previous-versions/azure/devops/reference/xml/automate-field-assignments-state-transition-reason).

## Limitations

There are the following limitations when querying by test case:
- **Hierarchical views**: You can’t construct a query that shows a hierarchical view of Test Plans, Test Suites, and Test Cases. These items aren’t linked together using parent-child link types.
- **Query-based test suites**: While you can create query-based test suites, the suite automatically includes every test case that gets returned by the query you define, which can sometimes lead to unintended test cases being included if the query isn’t precise.
- **Field limitations**: Some fields related to test cases, such as detailed execution results, might require creative usage of existing fields or customization of payload data to be fully utilized.
- **Performance and rate limits**: Azure DevOps imposes limits on the resources individuals can consume and the number of requests they can make. Nonoptimized queries or excessive API calls can lead to delays or blocked requests.
- **Test case linking**: Test cases aren’t automatically linked to other work items in a way that supports complex queries. For example, you can’t easily query for a hierarchical view of test cases linked to specific requirements or user stories.
