# Query by date or current iteration

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

In this article, learn how to list work items based on when they were created, closed, resolved, or changed. You can specify a date or use a supported macro. Use the `@Today` macro and specify a plus or minus number of days for relative dates. For queries that list work items based on their assignment to a team's current sprint, use `@CurrentIteration`.

For example, find work items that were modified in the last three days with the following query.

::: moniker range="<=azure-devops"
:::image type="content" source="media/example-work-item-queries/query-changed-date-last-3-days.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Query Editor showing the Changed Date field set to >= 3.":::
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<=azure-devops"
Also, you can use  the `CurrentIteration +/- _n_` macro to create queries based on a sliding window of team iterations.
::: moniker-end

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [prerequisites-queries](../includes/prerequisites-queries.md)]

## Supported operators and macros

Query clauses that specify a **DateTime** field or the **Iteration Path** field can use the operators and macros listed in the following table.

---
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      **Data type**
   :::column-end::: 
   :::column span="3":::
      **Supported operators and macros**
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
---
::: moniker range="<=azure-devops"
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      DateTime   
   :::column-end::: 
   :::column span="3":::
      `= , <> , > , < , >= , <= , =[Field], <>[Field], >[Field], <[Field], >=[Field], <=[Field], In, Not In, Was Ever`  

      **Macros**: `@StartOfDay`, `@StartOfWeek`, `@StartOfMonth`, `@StartOfYear`, and `@Today`.
      You can use `+/- _n_` with each of the supported macros.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
 ---
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      TreePath
   :::column-end::: 
   :::column span="3":::
      =, <>, Under, Not Under  
      **Macros**: `@CurrentIteration`<sup>1</sup> and `@CurrentIteration +/- n`<sup>2</sup> valid with the **Iteration Path** field.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
---
::: moniker-end

Notes:
1. The `@StartOfDay`, `@StartOfWeek`, `@StartOfMonth`, and `@StartOfYear` macros are supported for Azure DevOps Server 2020 and later versions. They're only supported when run from the web portal.
1. The `@CurrentIteration +/- n` macro is supported for Azure DevOps Server 2020 and later versions and is only supported when run from the web portal.

> [!TIP]
> The `WasEver` operator can be used with the **Iteration Path** field but only when defined through the WIQL syntax. For an example, see [Work Item Query Language (WIQL) syntax reference](wiql-syntax.md).

[!INCLUDE [date-time-pattern](../includes/date-time-pattern.md)]

<a id="team_view">  </a>
<a id="current_sprint_restrict"> </a>

## Client restrictions on the use of the @CurrentIteration macros

You can use the `@CurrentIteration` macro in a query from the following clients:

- Web portal that connects to Azure Boards
- Visual Studio 2019 or later versions connected to Azure Boards
- The REST API

You can use the `@CurrentIteration +/- n` macro in a query against Azure Boards, Azure DevOps Server 2020, and later versions, and with a REST API that includes the team as a parameter. An example is `@CurrentIteration('[Project]\Team')`.

An error occurs if you open a query that contains the `@CurrentIteration` macro in earlier versions of Visual Studio, or from Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Project. Also, you can't use the macro when [copying or cloning test suites and test cases](/previous-versions/azure/devops/test/mtm/copying-and-cloning-test-suites-and-test-cases), [defining alerts](../../organizations/notifications/about-notifications.md), or with [REST APIs](/rest/api/azure/devops/).

## Date-based queries

Filter for work items by the date on which they were changed or for a specific time period. Limit the scope of your query. This approach can help with performance by only returning results that fit the date range that you include. If you're new to creating queries, see [Define a work item query](using-queries.md).

Not all fields are valid for all work item types. Jump to [date fields](#date_fields) for the set of fields you can include in queries and the work item types to which they apply.

> [!TIP]
>
> - Remember to enter dates in the **Date Pattern** field that you set for your [personal profile](../../organizations/settings/set-your-preferences.md).
> - To understand how `AND/OR` clauses are grouped, see [Group clauses](../queries/using-queries.md#group-clauses). To view the WIQL syntax for a query, install the [WIQL editor extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.wiql-editor), which allows you to see the WIQL version of any Query Editor entry.

## Create queries for your team's current iteration

If your team follows Scrum processes, you schedule work to be completed in sprints. You can track the progress of requirements, bugs, and other work to be completed in the current sprint by using the `@CurrentIteration` macro. For more information, see [Manage sprint timelines](../sprints/define-sprints.md).

The query finds any item assigned to a sprint that corresponds to the current iteration path for the team. For example, if a team is on Sprint 5, the query returns items assigned to Sprint 5. Later, when the team is working in Sprint 6, the same query returns items assigned to Sprint 6.

> [!NOTE]
> For the `@CurrentIteration` macro to work, the team must select an iteration path whose date range encompasses the current date. For more information, see [Select team sprints and set the default iteration path](../../organizations/settings/set-iteration-paths-sprints.md#select-team-sprints-and-set-the-default-iteration-path). Also, queries that contain this macro are only valid when run from the web portal.
>
> See also [Client restrictions on the use of the @CurrentIteration macros](#current_sprint_restrict) earlier in this article.

::: moniker range="<=azure-devops"

Azure Boards adds a team parameter when you select the **@CurrentIteration** or **@CurrentIteration +/- _n_** macros. The team parameter derives from your current [team context](#team_view).

:::image type="content" source="media/query-date-iteration/at-current-with-team-parameter.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Query filter by using the CurrentIteration macro with team parameter.":::

> [!TIP]
> If the `@CurrentIteration` macro isn't working, check that the expected iteration is selected for your team and that dates are set for it. For more information, see [Select team sprints](../../organizations/settings/set-iteration-paths-sprints.md#select-team-sprints-and-set-the-default-iteration-path).

To change the team parameter that the system automatically sets, choose it by entering the name of the team in the parameter field added below the **@CurrentIteration** macro.

<a id="current-iteration-plus-minus-n">  </a>

## Create a sliding window of your team's iterations query

Use the `@CurrentIteration +/- n` macro when you want to track the work a team planned for upcoming sprints and for understanding work that wasn't completed in previous sprints.

> [!NOTE]
> For the `@CurrentIteration +/- n` macro to work, the team must select iteration paths that meet the `+/- n`
> criteria. Date ranges must encompass the current date for the `@CurrentIteration`. For more information about team selection of iteration paths, see [Select team sprints and set the default iteration path](../../organizations/settings/set-iteration-paths-sprints.md#select-team-sprints-and-set-the-default-iteration-path).
>
> See also [Client restrictions on the use of the @CurrentIteration macros](#current_sprint_restrict) earlier in this article.

The following image shows how to list all User Story and Bug work item types that are assigned to the sliding window. The window spans the last two, the current, and the next two sprints selected for the Cloud Admin and Tools team.

:::image type="content" source="media//query-date-iteration/sliding-window-iterations.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows CurrentIteration plus and minus clauses.":::

To use this macro, the specified team must [select a set of sprints](../../organizations/settings/set-iteration-paths-sprints.md) that span the `+/- n` value entered for thhave selectede macro.

## List work items moved out of a sprint

List work items that were defined for a sprint but later moved out by using a query with a clause that contains the `Was Ever` operator for the **Iteration Path** field. You can only construct this query by using the [WIQL syntax](wiql-syntax.md). Edit the WIQL syntax in Query Editor by installing the [WIQL Editor Marketplace extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.wiql-editor).

For example, the following syntax queries for work items meet the following criteria:

- Defined in the current project.
- Work item type equals User Story or Bug.
- Work items are under the Fabrikam Fiber Web team Area Path.
- Work items aren't in a `Closed`, `Completed`, `Cut`, or `Resolved` state.
- Not in the current iteration path for the Fabrikam Fiber Web team.
- Were assigned to the current iteration path for the Fabrikam Fiber Web team.
- Are now assigned to the current iteration +1 for the Fabrikam Fiber Web team.
- Were changed within the last 30 days (the length of the sprint).

```WIQL
SELECT
    [System.Id],
    [System.WorkItemType],
    [System.AssignedTo],
    [System.Title],
    [System.State],
    [System.Tags],
    [System.IterationPath],
    [System.AreaPath]
FROM workitems
WHERE
    [System.TeamProject] = @project
    AND [System.WorkItemType] IN ('User Story', 'Bug')
    AND [System.AreaPath] UNDER 'FabrikamFiber\Web'
    AND NOT [System.State] IN ('Completed', 'Closed', 'Cut', 'Resolved')
    AND NOT [System.IterationPath] = @currentIteration('[FabrikamFiber]\Web <id:cdf5e823-1179-4503-9fb1-a45e2c1bc6d4>')
    AND EVER [System.IterationPath] = @currentIteration('[FabrikamFiber]\Web <id:cdf5e823-1179-4503-9fb1-a45e2c1bc6d4>')
    AND [System.IterationPath] = @currentIteration('[FabrikamFiber]\Web <id:cdf5e823-1179-4503-9fb1-a45e2c1bc6d4>') + 1
    AND [System.ChangedDate] >= @today - 30
ORDER BY [System.Id]
```

The Query Editor view of the syntax appears as shown.

> [!NOTE]
> The Query Editor displays a :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/required-icon.png" border="false"::: information icon next to the `Was Ever` operator, indicating an issue with the clause. However, the query still runs and you can create query charts. To modify the query, you *must* use the [WIQL Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.wiql-editor).

:::image type="content" source="media/example-work-item-queries/query-work-items-moved-out-of-sprint.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Query Editor work items moved out of a sprint.":::

<a id="list-work-items-added-to-a-sprint"></a>

## List work items added to a sprint after the start date

To list newly created work items added to a sprint after its start date, use a query similar to the one shown in the following image. This query works by filtering for work items assigned to the current sprint but were created after the start of the sprint date. Use the clause `created Date = @Today - 28`.

:::image type="content" source="media/example-work-item-queries/query-work-items-added-to-sprint.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Query Editor work items newly created and added to a sprint after its start date.":::

## Date and Iteration Path fields

Notes:

1. See also [Query by assignment or workflow changes](query-by-workflow-changes.md).

1. For these fields to be defined for a work item type, they must be included in the `WORKFLOW` section of the work item type definition. For example, this syntax is included within the `FIELDS` definition when transitioning to a `Resolved` state.

   ```xml
   <FIELD refname="Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ResolvedDate" />  
      <SERVERDEFAULT from="clock"  />  
   </FIELD >  
   ```

1. **Start Date** and **Finish Date** values are calculated if you create a project plan in Project and then synchronize that plan with tasks that are stored in Azure Boards. These fields might not appear on the work item form, but they're calculated for the backlog items and tasks that are linked to backlog items. You can view their read-only values in results from a query or from Excel.
