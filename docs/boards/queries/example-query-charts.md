# Example query charts

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Query charts are excellent for visualizing status and trends. Adding multiple charts to a dashboard allows quick monitoring of essential data for your team or project. Consider discussing the following questions with your team:

- *Which query charts are most useful for us to create and monitor?*
- *Which charts help maintain backlog hygiene?*
- *What time frame should we use for trend charts?*

While teams might have varied goals and tracking needs, Agile teams typically perform these tasks. Select status and trend charts that support the following activities:

- [Triage incoming work](../sprints/best-practices-scrum.md#tips-for-successful-triage-meetings) to ensure new work is well defined
- Plan sprints and set sprint goals as described in [Scrum and best practices](../sprints/best-practices-scrum.md)
- Conduct [daily stand-ups](../sprints/best-practices-scrum.md#daily-scrum-meetings)

## Prerequisites

- **Access levels**: To create a query chart or view query charts from the Queries page, have at least **Basic** access.  
- **Permissions**:
  - To create or edit a shared query, have your **Contribute** permission set to **Allow** for the shared query folder.
  - To view a query chart added to a dashboard, have **Read** permissions to the underlying query. If this permission is denied, then the widget displays a *Widget failed to load* message.
- **Tasks**: To add a query chart to a dashboard, save the query under the **Shared Queries** folder.

> [!NOTE]  
> Users with [**Stakeholder** access](../../organizations/security/stakeholder-access.md) for a public project have full access to query chart features just like users with **Basic** access. Users with **Stakeholder** access for a private project can't view or create charts from the **Queries** page, however, they can view charts added to a team dashboard.

## Guidelines for creating query charts 

For detailed instructions on creating query charts, see [Track progress with status and trend query-based charts](../../report/dashboards/charts.md). Ensure your queries adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Query type:** Use **Flat list of work items** as only flat-list queries support query charts.
- **Save changes:** Save your query after modifying clauses or column options before navigating to the **Charts** page.
- **Operators:** Utilize **In** and **Not In** operators to include multiple work item types, workflow states, or other groupings.
- **Trend charts:** Limit queries for trend charts to a maximum of 1,000 work items to avoid widget errors.
- **Grouping fields:** Add relevant fields to your query clauses or column options. You can group charts by:
  - **State:** Include the **State** field.
  - **Assigned To:** Include the **Assigned To** field.
  - **Iteration Path:** Include the **Iteration Path** field.
  - **Node Name:** Include the **Node Name** field for team grouping.
  - **Custom Fields:** Include any custom fields as needed.
- **Summing numeric columns:** To sum a numeric column, include the corresponding field in your query clause or column options. For examples, see [Query by a numeric field](query-numeric.md).

### Limitations

You can't group charts by the following field data types:
- **ID** or **Parent** fields
- **Date-time** fields (for example, **Created Date**, **Changed Date**)
- **Plain Text** fields (for example, **Title**)
- **Rich-text** fields (for example, **Description**, **Acceptance Criteria**, **Repro Steps**)
- **Tags:** You can filter queries using tags, but can't use them to configure query charts.

> [!NOTE]
> While you can't group a query-based chart by tags, you can group a **Chart for Work Items** widget by tags added to a dashboard as described in [Configure a chart for work items widget](../../report/dashboards/configure-chart-work-items-widget.md).

### Adding query charts to dashboards

- **Create dashboard first:** To add a query chart to a dashboard, first create the dashboard. Then add the chart from the **Queries** > **Charts** page.
- **Refresh required:** After you add a query, refresh your browser to register the new query on the dashboard.
- **Optimize performance:** For complex queries, see [Best integration practices, Optimize queries](../../integrate/concepts/integration-bestpractices.md#optimize-queries).

## Maintain backlog hygiene 

The following queries help your team maintain a healthy backlog by ensuring that work is properly assigned. The following table provides example queries to review periodically, typically at the beginning or end of a sprint. Customize these queries to fit your team and organizational goals by replacing *Fabrikam Team* with your team name and adding other filters as needed.

> [!NOTE]  
> Work item types and workflow states applicable to your project might differ from those shown in the following examples depending on the process used by your project.

In the following image, all five query charts appear on a team dashboard. To add query charts to a dashboard, see [Add charts to a dashboard](../../report/dashboards/add-charts-to-dashboard.md#add-a-work-item-query-or-chart) 

:::image type="content" source="media/example-queries/dashboard-backlog-hygiene-query-charts.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Dashboard with five query charts added.":::  

Alternatively, you can add query tiles that reference the same query and show the total count of work items as shown in the following image. 

> [!NOTE]  
> The query tile widget is a 1x1 tile, whereas the smallest query chart dashboard widget is 2x2. To add query tiles to a dashboard, see [Add widgets to a dashboard](../../report/dashboards/add-widget-to-dashboard.md).

## Useful work tracking widgets and charts

In addition to the query charts provided earlier in this article, the following built-in widgets provide a wealth of information for teams working to monitor progress and continuous improvement goals. Each of these charts can be added to a team dashboard.
