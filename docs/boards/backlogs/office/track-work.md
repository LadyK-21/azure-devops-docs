# Connect Azure Boards to an Office client

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

::: moniker range="<=azure-devops"

To support your work tracking efforts, you can use Microsoft Excel. You can either work in online mode, where you're connected to either Azure Boards or Azure DevOps Server. Or, work in offline mode, where you access the local computer and document.

For more information, see [Resolve Azure DevOps and Office integration issues](tfs-office-integration-issues.md).

## Publish and refresh work items

::: moniker range="<=azure-devops"

When you add or update work items from Excel, local copies of your work items are created. To keep data in sync, refresh your local file when you open it and publish and refresh frequently during a long online session.

::: moniker-end

At first, the data in the local document matches the data in the database. But you or other team members can change the data about work items and cause the two to differ. To view the most recent changes from the database, refresh the document. The refresh downloads the latest values in the data store to your local document. To write changes from the document to the database, publish the changes. Publishing uploads the changes you made to the work item tracking data store.

To keep work items in sync from your local data store and Azure Boards, publish and refresh often.

### Azure DevOps and Excel

:::image type="content" source="media/connect/excel-sequence.png" alt-text="Diagram shows the Team Explorer and Excel workflow.":::

To work in Excel, see [Bulk add work items with Excel](bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md).

## Connect an Azure DevOps project to Excel

To add or modify work items by using Excel, connect your worksheet to a project. Establish this connection to bind the document to the Azure DevOps project to exchange information.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - This section illustrates how to connect Excel to an Azure Boards project. The steps to connect to PowerPoint are similar.
> - When you connect to Azure Boards in the cloud, the **Team Project Collection** automatically gets selected, because there's only one collection associated with your Azure DevOps Services organization. When you connect to Azure Boards in an on-premises server, choose the **Team Project Collection** before you choose the project.

You can start work from the web portal, Excel, or Visual Studio/Team Explorer. Your worksheet is associated with either a list of work items or a work item query.

### [Open query in Excel (web portal)](#tab/open-excel)

This connection method requires that you install [Azure DevOps Open in Excel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blueprint.vsts-open-work-items-in-excel). It also requires Visual Studio 2017 or later version.

1. From your web browser, check that you selected the right project, choose **Boards** > **Queries**, and then choose **All**.

For more information, see [Bulk add work items with Excel](bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md).

> [!TIP]
> You can use multiple worksheets within an Excel workbook to work with different input or query lists. You can only connect to one project per workbook.

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

If you move your Azure DevOps project to a different project collection in the same instance of Azure DevOps, your documents automatically reconnect. If the project moves to a different instance of Azure DevOps, you must manually reconnect your documents to the new server.

::: moniker-end

## Work offline and reconnect to Azure Boards

One advantage of working in Excel is that you can work offline and add or modify work items. The following procedures show you how to disconnect an Excel work item list from Azure Boards. You can then reconnect later to synchronize the document with the work item database.

> [!NOTE]
> If the project that contains work items for your Excel document is moved to a different organization or Azure DevOps Server instance, you must reconfigure the server to which the document connects. For more information, see [Connect Azure DevOps project to Excel](#connect-an-azure-devops-project-to-excel) earlier in this article.

### Disconnect a document file from the network

To disconnect an Excel document file from the network:

1. Open the document that you want to change while you're offline.

1. Refresh the work item list to retrieve the latest information from the work item database. In Excel, on the **Team** ribbon, in the **Work Items** group, choose **Refresh**.

1. Add to the work item list the columns for all fields that you want to modify. You can't add columns when the work item list is disconnected from the server.

1. Disconnect your computer from the network, or save the work item list file and copy it to another computer.

   An error message might appear that tells you the Office program couldn't establish a connection with an Azure DevOps Server.

1. Modify or update the work item list as needed.

   You can't create most types of links between work items when the work item document is disconnected from the system. The exceptions are parent-child links in an Excel tree list.

### Reconnect a file to Azure Boards

To reconnect an Excel document file:

1. Reconnect your computer to the network, or copy the file to a computer that is connected to Azure Boards.

1. If you changed the document offline, in Excel, on the **Team** ribbon, in the **Work Items** group, choose **Publish**.

1. If you didn't change the document offline, in Excel, on the **Team** ribbon, in the **Work Items** group, choose **Refresh**.

1. Resolve any data validation errors or conflicts that occur.
