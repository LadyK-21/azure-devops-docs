# Use backlogs to manage projects

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

With *backlogs*, you can plan your project by adding user stories or requirements to your product backlog. With your plan in place, you can start driving code development efforts.

If you're a project administrator, see [Configure and customize Azure Boards](../configure-customize.md), which shows you how to define area and iteration paths and customize your work item types. When you create a project or add a team, Azure Boards automatically creates a backlog. Each team has access to their own product, portfolio, and sprint backlogs. For more information, see [About teams and Agile tools](../../organizations/settings/about-teams-and-settings.md#each-team-gets-their-own-set-of-tools).

## About backlogs

An Azure Boards backlog is a prioritized list of work items that guides your developments team's effort. A backlog helps manage project scope and facilitates effective communication and collaboration through the software development lifecycle.

Use backlogs to do the following tasks:

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"  

- [Define user stories, product backlog items, or requirements](create-your-backlog.md)
- [Reorder your backlog](create-your-backlog.md#reorder-your-backlog)
- [Add details and estimates to your backlog items](create-your-backlog.md#add-details-and-estimates-to-backlog-items)  
- [Bulk update](bulk-modify-work-items.md)
- [Drag items to a sprint](../sprints/assign-work-sprint.md)
- [Map backlog items within a hierarchy](organize-backlog.md)  
- [Review the hierarchy or portfolio of work assigned to multiple teams](#multi-team)
- [Forecast work](../sprints/forecast.md)
- [Display rollup progress, counts, or totals](display-rollup.md)

::: moniker-end 

 

[!INCLUDE [note setup backlog](../includes/setup-backlogs-boards.md)]

## Product and portfolio backlogs

Backlogs present work items as lists. A *product backlog* represents your project plan, the roadmap for what your team plans to deliver. It also provides a repository of all the information  need to track and share with your team.

In [Agile methodologies](/devops/plan/what-is-agile), a *portfolio backlog* lets you group and organize your backlog into a hierarchy. You can display high-level initiatives, epics, or projects that your organization plans to work on over a longer period of time. These initiatives are often too large or complex to fit in the scope of a single team's backlog. They require coordination and planning at a higher organizational level.

## Backlog configuration

[!INCLUDE [note add backlog](../includes/note-add-backlog-board.md)]

Each backlog is associated with a team and the team configuration settings determine the work items that appear on the team backlog. The team administrator does the following tasks for their team:

- Select the Area Paths that are active for the team. Only work items assigned to these area paths appear on the team's backlog.
- Set the default Area Path and Iteration Path used when defining work items from the team backlog.
- Select the Iteration Paths that are active for the team.
- Determine which backlog levels are active for the team.
- Define how bugs get treated, as requirements or as tasks.

For more information, see the following articles: 

- [Define iteration (sprint) paths and configure team iterations](../../organizations/settings/set-iteration-paths-sprints.md)
- [Define area paths and assign to a team](../../organizations/settings/set-area-paths.md)
- [Select backlog levels](../../organizations/settings/select-backlog-navigation-levels.md)
- [Show bugs on backlogs or boards](../../organizations/settings/show-bugs-on-backlog.md)

[!INCLUDE [tip configure backlog view](../includes/tip-configure-backlog-view.md)]

### Common backlog configurations for multiple teams

**Question**: *Can you define a backlog configuration that multiple teams can subscribe to?*
**Answer**: *No. Each team controls their own team settings and backlog configurations.*

::: moniker range="azure-devops"
Because each user can configure their own **Column Options** and **View Options**, there's no way to configure a common backlog view for all teams. Also, there's no default column options that can be set for each team.  
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"
Because each user can configure their own **Column Options** and **View Options**, there's no way to configure a common backlog view for all teams. You can, however, define the default column options for all team members by editing the process configuration. To learn how, see [Process configuration XML element reference, Set default columns](../../reference/xml/process-configuration-xml-element.md#columns).
::: moniker-end

## Define work items and create your backlog

Build your project plan by creating a backlog of work items. These items represent the features, requirements, user stories, or other work to complete. Portfolio backlogs provide support for organizing work in a hierarchical fashion. They help track major product initiatives or scenarios that rely on many stories or requirements. Different types of work items help you track different types of work, such as user stories, tasks, bugs, and issues.  

[:::image type="content" source="media/overview/gs-planning-define-stories.png" alt-text="Diagram titled Define stories conceptual image of tasks.":::](create-your-backlog.md)[:::image type="content" source="media/overview/gs-planning-organize-backlog.png" alt-text="Diagram titled Organize backlog conceptual image of tasks.":::](organize-backlog.md)[:::image type="content" source="media/overview/gs-planning-manage-bugs.png" alt-text="Diagram titled Manage bugs conceptual image of tasks.":::](manage-bugs.md)[:::image type="content" source="media/overview/gs-planning-manage-issues.png" alt-text="Diagram titled Manage issues conceptual image of tasks.":::](manage-issues-impediments.md)

<a id="stack-rank"></a>

## Backlog priority or stack rank order

<a id="change-position"> </a> 

Where you add or move the items on the page determines the sequence of items on each backlog. For more information, see [Reorder your backlog](create-your-backlog.md#move-items-priority-order).

As you drag items within the backlog list, a background process updates the *Stack Rank* [(Agile and Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) processes)](../queries/planning-ranking-priorities.md) or *Backlog Priority* [(Scrum process)](../queries/planning-ranking-priorities.md) fields. The system uses these fields to track the relative ranking of items on the product, feature, epic, or other portfolio backlog. By default, these fields don't appear on the work item form.

:::image type="content" source="media/create-backlog/cyb-order-backlog.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to reorder work items.":::  

Don't use the bulk modify function to change the value of the backlog priority field. While you can assign a value to these fields, you assign the same value to all items that you select for bulk edit.  

The preferred method for bulk edit is to use multi-select to move items to the top, bottom, or specific position within the page. If you must edit one of the backlog order fields in bulk to get a large number of work items in the priority order you want, use [Excel](../backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md). You can export a query that contains the backlog items, update either the Backlog Priority or Stack Rank fields, and then publish your changes.

## In Progress items and work listed on the backlog

Backlogs are designed to display work that corresponds to a Proposed, In Progress, or Resolved category state. When you complete work and its state enters a *Done*, or *Closed* state, it falls off the backlog view. You can always [create a query](../queries/using-queries.md) to view completed work, or view the **Recently completed** pivot from the **Work Items** page. For more information, see [View and add work items](../work-items/view-add-work-items.md).

In general, you display all items that are in the **In Progress** category state, which corresponds to the *Active* and *Committed* states. To focus on work that is proposed but not in progress, you can toggle the backlog view to turn off [**In Progress**](create-your-backlog.md#convert-ideas). This toggle is useful when [forecasting your product backlog](../sprints/forecast.md).

If your backlog is missing items, check whether the **In Progress** view is turned off. For more information, see [Workflow states and state categories](../work-items/workflow-and-state-categories.md).

## Organize your backlog by mapping and reparenting backlog items

When you have many initiatives your teams are working on, you might want to group the work according to these initiatives. By defining features and epics, you can group your work into a three-tiered hierarchy consisting of epics, features, and backlog items.

For example, here the Customer Service team organized several backlog items under two features and one epic.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"  

:::image type="content" source="media/overview/customer-service-backlog-parents-on.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Backlog that shows parents and multi-team ownership.":::  

::: moniker-end

[!INCLUDE [display rollup](../includes/display-rollup-section.md)]

<a id="multi-team">  </a>

## Work with multi-team ownership of backlog items  

When you have several teams, your hierarchical views can show items that belong to other teams.

### View backlog items and parent items owned by other teams

Your team's product backlog lists only those items whose area path matches items assigned to your team. If you show parents, you see the parent epic of the features and backlog items, even if another team owns the epic or feature.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"  

Other team-owned items appear with an information icon :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/info.png" border="false":::.

:::image type="content" source="media/multi-ownership/customer-service-backlog-parents-on-s155.png" alt-text="Screenshot of backlog items and parent items owned by other teams.":::

> [!TIP]
> Add the **Node Name** field as a column to identify the area path/team associated with the work items.

::: moniker-end 

 

For more information, see [Define area paths and assign to a team](../../organizations/settings/set-area-paths.md).

### View epics and child items owned by other teams

Here's another example that shows the **Epics** backlog for the **Management** team. Drilling down, you can see all the backlog items and features, even though they belong to one of three different teams: Customer Service, Phone, and Web.  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"  

:::image type="content" source="media/multi-ownership/management-team-backlog-epics-s155.png" alt-text="Screenshot of view Epics and child items owned by other teams.":::

::: moniker-end 

 

From these views, you can reparent items that you own and items other teams own. You can't reorder items that another team owns.  

This organization enables management teams to focus on high-level features and epics, and development teams to focus on just the backlog items they're responsible to deliver. For example, you can create a team structure similar to this one with two management and three development teams. For more information, see [Create or add a team](../../organizations/settings/add-teams.md).

:::image type="content" source="media/ALM_OB_MultiTeam_C.png" alt-text="Diagram shows backlogs and multi-team ownership with a division between management and development teams.":::

For more information about hierarchical team and backlog structures, see [Manage your product and portfolio backlogs](../plans/portfolio-management.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You have the flexibility to establish child links with work items from different projects. However, if the processes differ between projects, the hierarchy won't be visible on the backlog for those child items that reside in the separate projects. Nonetheless, you can view all of the associated child items directly on the work item form.

### Reordering and reparenting work items

All backlogs and boards support dragging to reorder and reparent work items. Updates made to one team's backlogs and boards are reflected in other team backlogs and boards that share the same area path. You might need to refresh the page to view the changes.

You can only use dragging to reorder or reparent work items assigned to area paths selected for your team. When the **Parents** view option is enabled, work items might appear on your backlog that your team doesn't own. Anything that appears with the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/info.png" border="false"::: information icon can't be reordered or reparented because another team owns it.  

:::image type="content" source="../plans/media/config-teams/information-message-owned-by-other-team.png" alt-text="Screenshot of information message on team ownership.":::

<a id="leaf-node"></a>

## Display leaf node work items

Sprint backlogs and Taskboards only show the last node in a same-category hierarchy, called the *leaf node*.

[!INCLUDE [describe leaf node](../includes/display-leaf-nodes.md)]  

## Product backlog controls

You can use the following controls to change or filter your product backlog view.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you turn the **In Progress** control off, items that are in the *Active*, *Committed*, or *Resolved* states or in the In Progress category workflow state don't appear in the backlog. For more information about category workflow states, see [About workflow states in backlogs and boards](../work-items/workflow-and-state-categories.md).

::: moniker range="<=azure-devops"
For more information about using each of these controls, see [Configure your backlog view](configure-your-backlog-view.md).
