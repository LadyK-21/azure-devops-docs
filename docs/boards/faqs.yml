sections:
  - name: Access and permissions 
     
    questions: 

      - question: Who can contribute to Azure Boards? 
        answer: |
          As a member of an Azure Boards project, you can use most features to track work. Limitations to select features are based on the access level and security group to which a user is assigned. Other limitations can be imposed based on work tracking permissions or custom rules. For more information, see [Default permissions and access for Azure Boards](get-started/permissions-access-boards.md). 

      - question: How can noncontributors view or modify work items?  
        answer: |
          ::: moniker range="azure-devops"
          For private projects, you can grant access to an unlimited number of users by assigning them Stakeholder access. For public projects, anonymous users&mdash;ones who don't sign into the project&mdash;can view all work items. For more information, see [Stakeholder access quick reference](../organizations/security/stakeholder-access.md) and [Make a private project public](../organizations/projects/make-project-public.md).   
          Also, if your organization uses Microsoft Entra ID to manage user access, you can [add external users to your organization](../organizations/accounts/add-external-user.md).
          ::: moniker-end

          ::: moniker range="< azure-devops"
          You can grant access to an unlimited number of users by assigning them Stakeholder access. To learn more about the features they can access, see [Stakeholder access quick reference](../organizations/security/stakeholder-access.md).
          ::: moniker-end

      - question: How can I restrict viewing or modifying select work items?  
        answer: |
          You can restrict access by setting permissions for an area path. For more information, see the following articles: 
          - [Set work tracking and plan permissions](../organizations/security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md?toc=/azure/devops/boards/toc.json)
          - [Grant or restrict permissions to select tasks](../organizations/security/restrict-access.md?toc=/azure/devops/boards/toc.json) 
          
      - question: Can caching affect rules applied to work items?  
        answer: | 
          <a id="caching"></a>
          **Yes**. Conditional rules based on user or group membership get cached for your web browser. If you find yourself restricted to update a work item, you probably encountered one of these rules. For more information about conditional rules, see [Rules and rule evaluation](../organizations/settings/work/rule-reference.md).
          If your cache stores outdated rules, you can wait for the client cache to expire within three days, or you can clear the cache.    
          To clear the cache, run the following command in the browser command window and then refresh the browser: window.indexedDB.deleteDatabase("wit")

      - question: What client tools support work tracking with Azure Boards? 
        answer: |
          See [Tools and clients that connect to Azure DevOps](../user-guide/tools.md).

  - name: Work items  

    questions: 
      - question: Where should I start to learn about work items and work item types? 

        answer: |
          For an introduction to work items, see [About work items](work-items/about-work-items.md).  

      - question: How do I view all work items? 

        answer: |
          To view all work items defined in a project, open a query and add two clauses: 
          - `Work Item Type = [Any]`
          - `State = [Any]` 

          From there, you can add filters to refine the query. For more information, see [Create and save managed queries with the query editor](queries/using-queries.md).

      - question: Can a work item be assigned to several users or a user group? 

        answer: |
          **No**. Work items can only be assigned to a single user. Also, you can only add a user that is available from the [people picker](queries/query-by-workflow-changes.md#people-picker).    

      - question: What's the recommended method to group work? 

        answer: |
          The main method to group work is to assign it to the same area path. Area paths are used to group work items by product, feature, or business areas and to support teams responsible for work assigned to those areas. In addition, you can group work under a parent work item using parent-child links, referred to as a hierarchical grouping. 

          For a discussion of these two usages and the tools they support, see [Configuration and customization of Azure Boards, Area paths, product teams, and portfolio management](configure-customize.md#area-path).

      - question: How do I mark a task or work item as a milestone task?

        answer: |
          Milestone markers aren't used in Azure Boards work tracking, except for Delivery Plans. Delivery Plans provide a calendar view and allow you to define a milestone marker. For more information, see [Review team Delivery Plans](plans/review-team-plans.md).  

          However, you can use one or more of the following options to mark a work item as a milestone: 
          - Prepend or append the word **Milestone** in the title of your work item
          - [Add a work item tag](queries/add-tags-to-work-items.md) labeled **Milestone**   
          - [Add a custom field](../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-field.md) labeled **Milestone** and populate it with a pick list of milestones  
          - [Link work items](backlogs/add-link.md) using the Predecessor/Successor or Related link type to a milestone work item 
          - [Assign the milestone work item to the sprint](sprints/assign-work-sprint.md) in which it's targeted for completion.

      - question: How can I best track dependencies?
        answer: |
          You can track dependencies between work items by linking them using a related or other link type. See [Link work items to other objects](backlogs/add-link.md). 

          ::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2022"
          You can view dependencies using [Delivery Plans](plans/review-team-plans.md). 
          ::: moniker-end

          If you're tracking dependencies across one or more organizations, you might want to use the [Dependency Tracker](extensions/dependency-tracker.md).

      - question: What determines which work item type should be a parent for another work item type? 

        answer: |
          Each process defines four default backlog levels: the iteration backlog, requirement backlog, feature and epic portfolio backlogs. The work item types added to each backlog level are the natural work item types to form parent-child relationship and group work items into a hierarchy. For more information, see [Organize your backlog, map child work items to parents](backlogs/organize-backlog.md). To customize the process, see [Customize your backlogs or boards, Edit or rename the requirement backlog](../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-backlogs-boards.md).   

      - question: How do I copy or clone a work item with all linked items? 

        answer: |
          ::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"
          With Azure Boards (cloud service), you can choose to copy child work items when copying a work item. For more information, see [Copy or clone work items](backlogs/copy-clone-work-items.md#copy-clone).  
          ::: moniker-end

          

      - question: How do I bulk modify a rich-text field? 

        answer: | 
          See [Bulk modify work items, Bulk modify rich-text fields](backlogs/bulk-modify-work-items.md#rich-text).

  - name: Automation rules

    questions: 
      - question: Is there way to make the parent active when a child is active?
        answer: | 
          Yes, you can set your backlog level to include two different rules. The first rule it to set the parent as active when any of its children are set to active. The second rule is to set parent to resolved or closed when all the children are closed. These rules can be configured for backlog level. For more information, see [Automate work item state transitions](work-items/automate-work-item-state-transitions.md)

      - question: Why are my work items automatically changing state?  
        answer: | 
          Work items automatically change state after your team administrator set up automation rules on the backlog. Create rules to automatically set the state to active or closed depending on the state change of its children. For more information, see [Automate work item state transitions](work-items/automate-work-item-state-transitions.md).

      - question: Why are the rules not triggering when I reactivate a child item?  
        answer: | 
          Rules only trigger when the state of the child item moves from New to Active or into Closed. Rules don't trigger when the state of the child item moves from Closed back to Active. This is currently by design.

      - question: Can I set automation rules per work item type or state?  
        answer: | 
          No, the rules are applied to all work item types in that backlog level. We use state categories instead of states because state categories are consistent across all work item types.

      - question: Can I set up automation rules for user stories but not for features or epics?
        answer: | 
          Yes, rules are configured per backlog level. Automation rules on the user stories backlog don't affect features or epics. But, you can also set up rules separately for features and epics. For more information, see [Automate work item state transitions](work-items/automate-work-item-state-transitions.md).

      - question: Why are automation rules not working if the child or parent items belongs to a different team or project?
        answer: | 
          Rules only trigger if both the parent and children belong to the same team. We don’t want rules automatically triggered for items that belong to other teams. For more information, see [Automate work item state transitions](work-items/automate-work-item-state-transitions.md).

  - name: Backlogs and boards 

    questions: 
      - question: What's the difference between a backlog and a board?  
        answer: | 
          Each backlog and board represents a filtered set of work items based on team area path and iteration path assignments. Backlogs list work items, boards display work items as cards. To understand how the filtering is applied, see [About teams and Agile tools, Team defaults referenced by backlogs and boards](../organizations/settings/about-teams-and-settings.md#team-defaults-referenced-by-backlogs-and-boards).

      - question: How do I add a backlog or board?  
        answer: | 
          To add a backlog or board, you add a team. Each team is configured with its own set of backlogs and boards as described in [About teams and Agile tools](../organizations/settings/about-teams-and-settings.md). Each team can customize these Agile tools. 

      - question: What limits should I be aware of?  
        answer: | 
          Azure DevOps imposes limits such as the number of work items that display on a backlog or board, numbers of teams you can define, and more. For a full list, see [Work tracking, process, and project limits](../organizations/settings/work/object-limits.md). 

      - question: How do I migrate my existing backlog to Azure Boards?  
        answer: | 
          See [Azure Boards migration and integration](extensions/migrate-integrate.md).

      - question: How do the three types of backlogs--product, portfolio, and sprint backlogs--differ?
        answer: | 
          Each backlog lists a filtered set of work items based on the team's selected area path, iteration paths, and work item types.  
          - **Product backlog**: By default lists User Stories (Agile), Issues (Basic), Product Backlog Items and Bugs (Scrum), or Requirements (CMMI). Provides options to show **Parents**, **Forecast**, and **In Progress** or **Completed** child items.  
          - **Portfolio backlog**: By default lists Features (all process models) for the Features backlog, and Epics (Agile, Scrum, and CMMI) for the Epic backlog. Provides options to show **Parents** and **In Progress** or **Completed** child items. 
          - **Sprint backlog**: By default lists all product backlog items assigned to the selected iteration, regardless of status. Provides options to show **Work details**.

      - question: Can I define sprints and use them with my board? 
        answer: | 
          **Yes**. You can assign sprints to work items and filter your board based on the iteration path. For more information, see [Filter your board](./backlogs/filter-backlogs-boards-plans.md). 

      - question: If I manage bugs with tasks, can I add bugs as a checklist to a requirement? 
        answer: | 
           **No**. Task checklists only support the task work item type. 

      - question: How do I create a view of the critical path? 
        answer: | 
          Azure DevOps doesn't provide a native view of the critical path. In part, as Agile methodologies favor a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) over Critical Path Management (CPM). By using MVP, you identify the shortest path and dependencies by prioritizing epics, features, stories and tasks.

          That said, we recommend that you use [Delivery Plans](plans/review-team-plans.md) to view dependencies and a calendar view of work.  

          If your organization supports connection to Microsoft Project, you might find more [Marketplace extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=AzureDevOps&category=Azure%20Boards&sortBy=Relevance) that support connection of Azure DevOps to Microsoft Project.  

          For more context, see [The Critical Path on Agile Projects](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/the-critical-path-on-agile-projects) and [Running a lean startup on Azure DevOps](https://medium.com/@giladkhen/running-a-lean-startup-on-azure-devops-5934ced2cc42).

  - name: Rollup

    questions: 
      - question: How can I get a rollup of Story Points, Effort, or other work item fields? 

        answer: | 
          ::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"
          Rollup columns allow you to view progress bars or totals of numeric fields or descendant items within a hierarchy. Descendant items correspond to all child items within the hierarchy. You can add one or more rollup columns to a product or portfolio backlog. You can add rollup columns to a product or portfolio backlog. See {Display rollup progress or totals](backlogs/display-rollup.md). 
          ::: moniker-end
          
  
      - question: Can I get a rollup of team capacity?

        answer: | 
          **No**. The data entered for team capacity isn't stored in the regular data stores.
 

  - name: Boards

    questions: 
      - question: Is there a way to widen columns on a board? 

        answer: | 
          **No**. This feature isn't supported. It's a suggested feature, which you can upvote by going to our [Developer Community page](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Resize-board-column-width/901212?space=21&q=column+width).

      - question: Can I query based on board columns? 

        answer: | 
          **Yes**, see [Query by assignment or workflow changes, board change queries](queries/query-by-workflow-changes.md#query-changes-to-a-kanban-board). 

      - question: Can I view a query as a board? 

        answer: | 
          **Yes**, by adding the [Query Based Boards](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=realdolmen.EdTro-AzureDevOps-Extensions-QueryBasedBoards-Public) Marketplace extension. 

      - question: Is there a way to copy a board configuration to another team?  

        answer: | 
           **Yes**, by adding the [Azure Boards Kanban Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alm-devops-rangers.KanbanBoardTools) Marketplace extension. 
      
      - question: Can I list items based on their column assignment?

        answer: |
            **Yes**, you can track column moves on a board by using the [Board Column and Board Column Done fields](queries/query-by-workflow-changes.md#kanban_query_fields).

      - question: What if I get the error message, "The column configurations aren't valid"?

        answer: |
            If you get the following error when you open your board, you need to correct the configuration. The main reason for this error is that the workflow states of work item types added to the **Requirement** category aren't mapped to the column. 

            > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
            > ![Screenshot that shows a configuration error message on a board.](./backlogs/media/setup-backlog/column-config-error.png)

            Select **Correct this now** to open the **Settings** dialog.
            In the following example, two new states are added: **Triaged** for bug, and **Investigate** for user story. Each state is then mapped to an existing or new column. After each state is mapped to a column, the board displays the work items assigned to these states.  
            > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
            > ![Screenshot showing board settings, columns.](./boards/media/add-columns-custom-states-mapping.png)  

      - question: Can I use swimlanes and set up swimlane rules?

        answer:  |
            **Yes**, you can [add or remove swimlanes](boards/expedite-work.md) on your board. You can also [set up swimlane rules](boards/expedite-work.md#set-up-swimlane-rules), where when certain conditions are met, Azure Boards automatically moves work items into specific lanes.

  - name: Work item templates  

    questions: 

      - question: Where should I start to learn about work item templates? 
        answer: |
          You can define work item templates for teams you belong to. To define work item templates to specify defaults for select fields, see [Use templates to add and update work items](backlogs/work-item-template.md).

      - question: How do I set a default template for a team? 
        answer: |
          The feature to set a default template for a team isn't a supported feature at this time. 

      - question: Can I copy a work item template to another team or project? 
        answer: |
          **No**. This feature isn't supported at this time.  

      - question: Can I create a work item template that creates links to other work items?   

        answer: |
          **Example request**: *When creating a template, I would like the Parent User Story to be defaulted. There isn't a predetermined field in the template. Would/could this function be under a user-defined selection?*  

          No, there's no native support for creating hierarchy templates. In particular, you can't specify a default parent work item. You can, however, quickly copy tasks, bugs, and other items using [Excel](backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md) to apply parent-child links in a tree list. Or, you can use a board to add child tasks, backlog items, or features. For more information, see:  
          - [Add task checklists](boards/add-task-checklists.md)
          - [Add, run, and update inline tests](boards/add-run-update-tests.md) 
          - [Add features and epics](boards/kanban-epics-features-stories.md)  

          ::: moniker range="<=azure-devops"
          Alternatively, you might find a solution for creating child work items by installing one of the following Marketplace extensions:  
          - [Work item form one-click actions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mohitbagra.witoneclickactions)  
          - [1-Click Child-Links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ruifig.vsts-work-item-one-click-child-links)  
          - [1-Click Tasks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ruifig.vsts-work-item-one-click-tasks) 
          ::: moniker-end

      - question: How do I delete a work item template?
        answer: |
          From the work item type page, choose  :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: the actions icon for an existing template and select the **Delete** option. 
            
          > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
          > ![Delete template](backlogs/media/templates/delete-template.png)

  - name: GitHub integration

    questions: 
      - question: How do I connect Azure Boards to GitHub?

        answer: | 
          See [Azure Boards & GitHub](github/index.md).

      - question: Can I specify the status when linking a work item to a GitHub commit or PR?

        answer: | 
          **No**. This feature isn't supported at this time. 

  - name: Configuration and customizations 
    questions:
