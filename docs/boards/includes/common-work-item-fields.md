## Definitions for common work tracking fields  

<a id="definitions-in-common"></a>

The following fields and tabs appear in most work items. Each tab is used to track specific information. Commonly used tabs include :::image type="icon" source="../backlogs/media/icon-history-tab-wi.png"::: **History**, :::image type="icon" source="../backlogs/media/icon-links-tab-wi.png"::: **Links**, and :::image type="icon" source="../backlogs/media/icon-attachments-tab-wi.png"::: **Attachments**.

The only required field for all work item types is **Title**. When you save a work item, the system assigns a unique identifier, **ID**. The form highlights required fields in yellow. For information about other fields, see [Work item field index](../work-items/guidance/work-item-field.md).   

> [!NOTE]   
> Other fields might be required depending on customizations made to your process and project.
