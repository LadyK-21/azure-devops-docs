Define iteration paths and assign them to teams when you want to use the following tools: 

- [Assign work items to sprints by using the Planning pane](../sprints/assign-work-sprint.md)
- [Chart work items based on Iteration Path](../queries/query-by-area-iteration-path.md)
- [Forecast product backlog](../sprints/forecast.md)
- [Implement Scrum practices (all tools) for your team](../sprints/scrum-overview.md) 
- [Use Delivery Plans and calendar views](../plans/review-team-plans.md)  
- [Chart team velocity](../../report/dashboards/team-velocity.md) and [Chart Sprint burndown](../../report/dashboards/configure-sprint-burndown.md)  

> [!TIP]    
> If your team doesn't subscribe to or select a specific iteration path, the iteration path isn't visible in the team view or in the tool.
