To perform the following tasks, you must define area paths: 

- [Query and chart work items based on area paths](../queries/query-by-area-iteration-path.md)
- [Assign work to more than one team](../../organizations/settings/add-teams.md) 
- [Work with management and feature teams](../plans/configure-hierarchical-teams.md)
- [Filter a backlog, query, board, or plan by using area paths](../backlogs/filter-backlogs-boards-plans.md)

> [!TIP]    
> You can define your area path structure and assign area paths to teams. You can also add a team and create the area path with the team name at the same time. If teams are fully independent, create a flat set of area paths. To build a hierarchy of teams, create a tree-hierarchy of area paths. For more information, see [Configure a hierarchy of teams](../plans/configure-hierarchical-teams.md).

To use the following tools, teams must subscribe to area paths: 

- [Boards > all tools](../boards/kanban-overview.md)    
- [Backlogs > all tools](../backlogs/backlogs-overview.md)    
- [Sprints > all tools](../sprints/scrum-overview.md)   
- [Delivery plans](../plans/review-team-plans.md)
- [Rollup](../configure-customize.md#rollup)  
- [Analytics > all tools](../../report/dashboards/overview.md#in-context-reports-work-tracking)
