You can create a hierarchy of backlog items, tasks, and bugs. We don't recommend that you create same-category hierarchies. In other words, don't create parent-child links for work items of the same type, such as story-story, bug-bug, or task-task.

The last node in a same-category hierarchy might only appear on boards, sprint backlogs, and Taskboards. For example, if you link items within a same-category hierarchy that's four levels deep, only the items at the fourth level appear on the board, sprint backlog, and Taskboard.  

Rather than nest requirements, bugs, and tasks, we recommend that you maintain a flat list. Create parent-child links one level deep between items that belong to a different category. For more information, see [Troubleshoot reordering and nesting issues](../backlogs/resolve-backlog-reorder-issues.md).
