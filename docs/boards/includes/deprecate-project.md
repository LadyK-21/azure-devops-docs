> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Microsoft Project Integration is no longer supported**
>
> Microsoft Project Integration and the `TFSFieldMapping` command are discontinued for:
> - Visual Studio 2019 and later versions (including Azure DevOps Office Integration)
> - Azure DevOps Server 2020 and later versions
> - Azure DevOps Services
>
> **What still works:** Microsoft Excel integration remains fully supported for bulk import and update of work items.
>
> **Recommended alternatives:**
> - **[Delivery Plans](../plans/review-team-plans.md)** - Native Azure DevOps feature for project planning and cross-team tracking
> - **Project management extensions** - Browse the [Azure DevOps Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=project%20management&target=AzureDevOps&category=Azure%20Boards&sortBy=Installs) for current Gantt chart and project management solutions
> - **Third-party integrations** - Many project management tools offer Azure DevOps connectors for seamless workflow integration
