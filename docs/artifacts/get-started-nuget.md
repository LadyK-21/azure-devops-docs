# Publish and download NuGet packages with Azure Artifacts

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2020](../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)]

Azure Artifacts enables developers to publish and download NuGet packages from feeds or public registries. Feeds can be either private, allowing you to share packages with specific users, or public, making your packages accessible to anyone on the internet.

This article guides you through creating a feed, configuring your project, and publishing and downloading NuGet packages.

## Prerequisites

## Publish packages to your feed

To publish a package to your feed, run the following command. The `ApiKey` parameter is required, but you can use any arbitrary string as its value.

```CLI
nuget.exe push -Source <SOURCE_NAME> -ApiKey key <PACKAGE_PATH>
```

#### Examples

- **Project-scoped feed**:

    ```CLI
    nuget.exe push -Source https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/myOrganization/MyProject/_packaging/MyFeed/nuget/v3/index.json -ApiKey AZ release/myDemoPackage.1.0.0.nupkg
    ```

- **Organization-scoped feed**:

    ```CLI
    nuget.exe push -Source https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/myOrganization/_packaging/myFeed/nuget/v3/index.json -ApiKey AZ release/myDemoPackage.1.0.0.nupkg
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> The `ApiKey` is required, but you can use any arbitrary value when publishing to Azure Artifacts feeds.

## Download packages from your feed

To restore packages from your feed, run the following command in your project directory:

```CLI
nuget.exe restore
```
