# Migrate pages from the wiki extension to a team project wiki

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)] 

Learn how to migrate pages created using the Wiki Marketplace  extension to your team project wiki. You can save any wiki pages created using the Wiki Marketplace extension to a Git repo in your team project.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Wiki Marketplace  extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.wiki) is deprecated. [Uninstall it](../../marketplace/install-extension.md) after you migrate your pages.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [wiki-prerequisites](includes/wiki-prerequisites.md)]

## Overview of migrating pages and other artifacts

1. Clone the [vsts-wikiTools](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-wikiTools) repository and compile the **MigrateToVSTSWiki** tool.
2. Create, and then clone your Azure DevOps wiki.
3. Move and commit all Markdown pages to your Azure DevOps wiki.
4. Run the wiki migration tool, *MigrateToVSTSWiki.exe*
5. When the wiki migration tool is complete, push the changes to the default main branch, `wikiMain`, of the Azure DevOps wiki repository.

## Migrate pages from the wiki extension

1. Clone the [vsts-wikiTools](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-wikiTools) repository and compile the **MigrateToVSTSWiki** tool.
2. To generate the migration tool EXE, compile the project under the path `Tools/MigrateToVSTSWiki`.
3. From a web browser, open your Azure DevOps team project and [create your first wiki page](wiki-create-repo.md).
4. To clone your wiki, get the URL. For more information, see [Clone your wiki and edit wiki pages offline](wiki-update-offline.md).  
   Name this clone location as `LocationA` for this procedure.
5. Clone your wiki repo using your IDE or the **git clone** command.
6. Clone the wiki extension repo. The wiki is mapped to a folder given to you during the wiki creation. You can confirm by going to the **manage wiki** option in the existing wiki, as shown in the following example.
   Your existing wiki pages are saved under the folder labeled `Root`.

   For example, you cloned the previously mentioned `sampleWiki` in the location `C:\wiki\sampleWiki*. The wiki pages are saved in the path *C:\wiki\sampleWiki\ _extensionWiki`

   Name this location as `LocationB` for this procedure.

7. Create an empty folder in any path on your local machine, and name it `LocationC` for this procedure.  

   In summary, the following locations are represented as follows:
   - Location A = Azure DevOps Wiki repo
   - Location B = Wiki extension repo
   - Location C = Empty folder to run migration tool in

8. Open a command prompt as an administrator and run `MigrateToVSTSWiki.exe`. This tool copies the files from your existing wiki to the destination directory you provide. During copying, the tool converts the pages to be compliant with the Azure DevOps wiki.

	`MigrateToVSTSWiki.exe /source:LocationB /destination:LocationC`

	For example:
	- `E:\wiki\sampleWiki\_extensionWiki` is the folder in which the existing wiki files are present
	- `E:\Temp\Wiki\New` is the empty folder into which the migrated files are to be copied.

9. Remove all the files from `LocationA` (if any) apart from the Git related files, such as `.gitignore`, and so on.

10. Copy all the files from `LocationC` and paste them into `LocationA`.
11. Run `git add .` to stage all the newly added files in `LocationA` for the commit.
12. Run `git commit -m <commit message>` to commit the locally staged files.
13. Run `git push origin wikiMain -f` to push the changes to the default branch of the Azure DevOps wiki.

After you migrate your wiki extension files to the Azure DevOps wiki, you're ready to uninstall the Wiki extension.
