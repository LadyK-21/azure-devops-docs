title: FAQs about working across projects

summary: | 
    Many enterprise organizations create multiple projects to meet their business needs. Although we recommend maintaining a single project for simplicity, there are situations where multiple projects are necessary. Working with two or more projects raises several questions about the tasks that are supported.

    This article answers those questions. For more information about specific cross-project features, see [Work across projects](navigation/work-across-projects.md).

  - name: Projects
    questions: 
      - question: How many projects should I create?
        answer: |
          In general, we recommend that you create a single project. However, certain business needs, such as supporting a public project or applying security policies, might require creating more than one project. For more information, see one of the following articles.
          - [About projects and scaling your organization](../organizations/projects/about-projects.md)
          - [Plan your organizational structure](../user-guide/plan-your-azure-devops-org-structure.md)
          - [What is a public project?](../organizations/projects/about-projects.md) 

      - question: Can I connect to more than one project at a time?
        answer: |
          When you connect from a web browser, you can connect to different projects from different browser tabs. When you connect from a client or IDE, you can only connect to a single project at a time. For more information, see [Connect to team projects](../organizations/projects/connect-to-projects.md). 

      - question: How do I view all projects available to me?
        answer: See [Switch project, repository, team](navigation/go-to-project-repo.md).

      - question: How do I turn off cross-project collaboration? 
        answer: | 
          If you want to limit users to view or modify select work items, [set permissions on Area Paths](../organizations/security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md#set-permissions-area-path). However, there's no method for limiting users to linking work items that reside in different projects.

  - name: Dashboards and reports
    questions:
      - question: Can I create a dashboard with information that spans two or more projects? 
        answer: | 
          ::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"
          There's limited support for widgets that you add to a dashboard from different projects. Specifically, you can add [Burndown and Burnup charts](../report/dashboards/configure-burndown-burnup-widgets.md) from different projects to a dashboard. Query-based widgets reference queries that you define, which can [reference other projects](../boards/queries/using-queries.md). You can also use an [Embedded Webpage widget](../report/dashboards/widget-catalog.md#embedded-webpage-widget) to display data from a URL, such as a backlog, board, or an **Analytics** chart from for a team. However, the backlog, board, or chart displays using the display preferences set by the currently logged in user viewing the dashboard.

          > [!NOTE]  
          > There's a [suggested feature, Single Dashboard for Multiple Projects](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/single-dashboard-for-multiple-projects/365500) that you can review and up vote.  
      - question: Can I create a report that spans two or more projects? 
        answer: | 
          ::: moniker range="<=azure-devops"
          **Yes**. The Analytics service and Power BI reports support the creation of reports that span two or more projects. For more information, see [Create a Power BI report with an OData Query](../report/powerbi/create-quick-report-odataq.md).

  - name: Azure Boards and work tracking
    questions: 
      - question: Can I query across projects? 
        answer: |
          **Yes**. You can create work item queries that span all projects within an organization or filter for specific projects. Also, you can use the search tool to perform work item searches across all projects in an organization. For more information, see one of the following articles.
          - [Define a query, Query across projects](../boards/queries/using-queries.md) 
          - [Search for work items](search/functional-work-item-search.md)

      - question: Can I view a board of work items defined in different projects? 
        answer: |
          **Yes**. The [Query Based Boards](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=realdolmen.EdTro-AzureDevOps-Extensions-QueryBasedBoards-Public) Marketplace extension supports this feature. You can view a board view of a flat-list query of work items.

      - question: Can I link work items across projects? 
        answer: |
          **Yes**. You can use any link type you want to link work items defined in different projects. You must define the projects within the same organization or project collection. For more information, see [Link user stories, issues, bugs, and other work items](../boards/backlogs/add-link.md).

      - question: Can I query for work items linked across projects? 
        answer:  |
          **No**. There's a prohibitive performance cost for trying to execute such a query, so it isn't supported.

      - question: Can I export a cross-project query to Excel? 
        answer: |
          ::: moniker range="<=azure-devops"
          **No**. Cross-project queries don't open in Excel. However, you can export a cross-project query to a .csv file, open it in Excel, and import it to Azure Boards. For more information, see [Bulk import or update work items using CSV files](../boards/queries/import-work-items-from-csv.md). 
          ::: moniker-end
          

      - question: Can I link work items across organizations or collections?
        answer: |
          ::: moniker range="azure-devops"
          **Yes** across organizations. See [Link user stories, issues, bugs, and other work items; Link to a remote work item](../boards/backlogs/add-link.md). 
          ::: moniker-end
          ::: moniker range="< azure-devops"
          **No** across collections, as it isn't a supported feature.
          ::: moniker-end

      - question: Can I perform capacity planning across projects?
        answer: |
          **No**. Azure Devops doesn't store capacity planning data in the work tracking data store or Analytics service, as it isn't a supported feature.  

      - question: How do I manage dependencies across projects?
        answer: |
          To manage dependencies in Azure Boards, you can link work items using the Predecessor/Successor link type. To learn how, see [Link user stories, issues, bugs, and other work items](../boards/backlogs/add-link.md).

      - question: Can I query for work items linked across projects?
        answer: |
          **No**. There's a prohibitive performance cost for trying to execute such a query, so it isn't supported.

    questions:
      - question: Can I apply an Inherited process defined in one organization to another organization?  
        answer: |
          **Yes**. To perform this operation, you need to export the process and import it to the other organization. While there's no import/export user interface, you can use the [Process Migrator for Node.js](https://github.com/Microsoft/process-migrator) application.  
 
      - question: Can I apply an Inherited process defined in one collection to another collection?  
        answer: |
          **Yes**. To perform this operation, you need to export the process and import it to the other collection. While there's no import/export user interface, you can use the [Process Migrator for Node.js](https://github.com/Microsoft/process-migrator) application.  

  - name: Azure Repos 
    questions:
      - question: Can I set branch policies across repositories within a project? 
        answer: |
          ::: moniker range="azure-devops"
          **Yes**. Cross-repository policies apply to all or a selection of the repositories in the projects. Do so from **Project settings** > **Repositories** > **Policies**. Add a custom policy and specify if it's for all repositories or choose to which repositories it should apply. For more information about branch policies, see [Improve code quality with branch policies](../repos/git/branch-policies.md).
          ::: moniker-end
          ::: moniker range="azure-devops-2020"
          **Yes**. Cross-repository policies apply to all or a selection of the repositories in the projects. Do so from **Project settings** > **Cross-repo policies**. Add branch protection and specify if it's for all repositories or choose to which repositories it should apply. For more information, see [Cross-repo branch policy administration](/azure/devops/release-notes/2019/sprint-160-update#cross-repo-branch-policy-administration) and [Improve code quality with branch policies](../repos/git/branch-policies.md).

      - question: How can I find all completed pull requests across projects? 
        answer: |
          There's no user interface feature to extract this information. You can use the REST API to get this information as follows:  
          1. Get all projects using [Projects-List](/rest/api/azure/devops/core/projects/list).
          1. Get all repositories of each project using [Repositories - List](/rest/api/azure/devops/git/repositories/list).
          1. Get all pull requests of each repository using [Pull Requests - Get Pull Requests](/rest/api/azure/devops/git/pull-requests/get-pull-request#pullrequeststatus).
